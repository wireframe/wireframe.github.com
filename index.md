### I'm a Web Developer with a passion for...

* Getting things done using Lean Startup practices
* Writing elegantly simple code with Ruby and Javascript
* Contributing to Opensource projects and building up developer communities

### But that's not all!

I focus on Ruby, Rails, Testing, REST API's, Chrome extensions and pretty much any new and exciting Web technology.

### Opensource Projects

I'm an avid opensource developer with a long history of involvement in the opensource community.
The majority of my work can be found on [Github](https://github.com/wireframe).
Some of my projects include:
