### I'm a web developer with a passion for...

* Getting things done using Lean Startup practices

* Contributing to opensource and building developer communities

### But that's not all!

My focuses also include: testing, REST API's, and pretty much any exciting web technology.

The majority of my work can be found on [Github](https://github.com/wireframe).
