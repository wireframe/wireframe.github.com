<p>You may see a new maven2 plugin showing up soon at the <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/">Codehaus Mojo project sandbox</a>.  I just submitted a new maven2 plugin for generating an HTML report using <a href="http://agiledox.sourceforge.net/">TestDox</a>.  This should make a great accessory report to the existing maven junit reports, and should be more usable by non-techie folks.</p><br /><br /><p>I've <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe?entry=running_code_doesn_t_lie">written about TestDox in the past</a>, and I finally got off my lazy ass because it has tremendous value for me.  It actually was pretty painless to create, and there's definitely opportunities for improvements, but hey, it works.  </p><br /><br /><p>Here's an example of what the output will be.  The only difference is that the report will be fully integrated with the maven generated site with all the fancy links and menus.</p><br /><br /><h3>TestDoxFormatter</h3><br /><ul><br />  <li>Pretty class name removes test suffix</li><br />  <li>Pretty method name removes test prefix</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p>Enjoy, and make sure to let me know what would make this plugin more useful.</p></div>
