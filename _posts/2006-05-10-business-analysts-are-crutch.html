<p>I've come to the realization that there is no "silver bullet" for software development processes. I personally believe that agile software development practices have great benefit for <i>most</i> teams. That being said, I no longer believe that <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> is the right solution for <i>every</i> development team.</p><br /><br /><p>There are certainly developers I know that just couldn't handle moving to a more agile development environment. They are too comfortable with the "black box" development environment where business analysts tell them what to build, and they just code...no questions asked. </p><br /><br /><p>Business analysts are simply a crutch for developers in this waterfall development environment. The idea that <i>all</i> requirements and functionality can be gathered before implementation is a falicy. I have <i>yet</i> to work on a single project that didn't undergo some form of change once implementation began.  And yet, business analysts spend weeks gathering requirements, then "throw it over the wall" for developers to implement. </p><br /><br /><p>Business analysts serve their purpose as a developer "safety blanket". Their job is to make developers all warm and fuzzy inside, and soothe any worries about how the project should work. Developers are not <i>expected</i> to be held accountable for what they build, and this is my biggest issue with this environment.</p><br /><br /><p>"The only thing constant is <i>change</i>." Why not <i>embrace</i> it?</p></div>
