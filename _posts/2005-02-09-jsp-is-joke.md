Just when I thought JSP couldn't get any worse, Sun announces that they are submitting [a JSR to manipulate webservices directly from JSP's.](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=267) My [previous blog]({% post_url 2004-10-22-two-faces-of-jsp %}) listed a few things I find completely unacceptable with the current JSP technology. It's almost as if JSP is the "kitchen sink" technology. Need to access databases? Yeah, we've got a tag library for that. Need to call webservices? Yep, you can do that too. What's next? Need to pull data from legacy systems, transform to xml, and write to the user's file system with javascript validation?


Sun claims that this spec is useful:


"A JSP tag library for Web Services is a happy union of the two technologies that will help JSP page authors integrate Web Services into their web applications with minimal effort and quick turnaround times."


"A Happy Union"? I would call it, "A Shotgun Wedding". Why can't someone see that this is a terrible, terrible idea?
