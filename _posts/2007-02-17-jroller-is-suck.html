<p>I haven't been the biggest fan of JRoller, and now they've sunk to a new low, adding spam to my RSS feed.  This comes at a time when JRoller might <i>finally</i> be getting some good press for <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t59326.html">breaking 10,000 users</a>.  </p><br /><br /><p>Who the crap is DZone and why are they scamming my RSS feeds!? <br /><br /><i><quote><br />Tired of your job? Need to hire developers? Visit DZone Jobs: great people, great opportunities.<br /></quote></i></p><br /><br /><p>Well, I'm <i>tired</i> of this crappy service!  Time to look for a new provider.  Luckily those of you subscribing to this feed using my feedburner url will not be affected by any changes.  Any suggestions other than blogspot for blog hosting?</p><br /><br /><p>I probably wouldn't have caught this except for the fact that I subscribe to my own RSS feed, and started seeing this junk after each post.  Nice try JRoller!  You can't slip something like this past me!</p><br /></div>
