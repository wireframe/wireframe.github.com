<div class='post'>
<p>And now for a short break from my techo blog...</p><br /><br /><p>There's been a lot of talk lately about <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/27/katrina.brown/index.html">who's to blame for problems in our world</a>. This constant bickering has pushed me too far, and so I've decided to post two simple statements that I constantly run through my head on any given day.  If more people would ponder these types of statements, more time would be spent fixing problems instead of bitching about them.<p><br /><br /><p><i>"How are <i>you</i> going to change the world, right here, right now?"</i></p><br /><br /><p><i>"If you don't do it, <i>noone</i> else will."</i></p><br /><br /><p>This second statement is one I find especially relevent.  So many American's have the mentaility that, <i>"If you don't do it, <i>someone</i> else will."</i>  This ultimately leads to lazyness because if the person next to you has the same belief, it turns into a never ending chain of inaction.</p></div>
