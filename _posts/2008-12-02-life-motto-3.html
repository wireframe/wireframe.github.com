<span style="font-style: italic;">"Do your job.....plus one....</span>"<br style="font-style: italic;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">- Me</span><br /><br />This is somewhat related to my previous post, but slightly different.&nbsp; My previous post was about not putting off to to tomorrow what you can do today.&nbsp; This is about going the extra mile in what you do.&nbsp; It's <span style="font-style: italic;">very</span> easy to "Just do your job", which inevitably leads to shoddy work with plenty of loose ends.&nbsp; If you <span style="font-weight: bold;">really</span> care about what you're doing, it's necessary to take the extra step to put the final touches on things.<br /><br />Similar quote:<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">"It takes 90% effort to complete 90% of the work.&nbsp; It takes </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">another</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> 90% effort to complete the job.</span>"<br /><br style="font-style: italic;" /></div>
