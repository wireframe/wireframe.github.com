<p>Here's the scenario:&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">project foo</span> is a widely used program that has been around for quite a while.&nbsp; It's starting to show it's age, yet people still use it because it's the unofficial standard (ex: struts, pcgen).&nbsp; A new application, <span style="font-weight: bold;">project new</span>,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>solves many of the shortcomings of <span style="font-weight: bold;">project foo</span> (ex: webwork, shard).&nbsp; Why hasn't <span style="font-weight: bold;">project new</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>achieved the sucess of <span style="font-weight: bold;">project foo </span>if it's better than <span style="font-weight: bold;">project foo</span>?<br /></p>I've come to the conclusion that a project can not be successful by <span style="font-style: italic;">solely </span>being better. Sure, it's good for a project to have newer technologies, better architecture, cleaner code, but that's not why users change to newer applications.&nbsp; If <span style="font-weight: bold;">project new</span> proclaims, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Stop using </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">project foo</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!&nbsp; Use </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">project new</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> because we're better!</span>", users will simply sigh and continue using their current application.&nbsp; The bottom line is that if you want users to start using <span style="font-weight: bold;">project new</span>, you need to also support <span style="font-weight: bold;">project foo</span>!<p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a> is a good example of this.&nbsp; The majority of people don't start using OpenOffice simply because it's "better".&nbsp; They take the OpenOffice plunge once they feel comfortable that OpenOffice will <span style="font-style: italic;">still</span> support their existing Microsoft Word documents.<br /></p><p> </p><p>This has been particularly relevant to me, as I try to figure out how to make <a href="http://shard.codecrate.com">shard</a> a successful open source project.&nbsp; <a href="http://pcgen.sf.net">PCGen</a> is currently the "top dog" when it comes to d20 applications, and user's aren't going to migrate to shard simply because it's better.&nbsp; Shard has many significant improvements over PCGen (database support, simple user interface, etc), but that alone is not going to convert users.&nbsp; What is really needed is for shard to help users migrate from PCGen quickly and easily.&nbsp; The next version of shard will <span style="font-weight: bold;">officially</span> support importing PCGen datasets into shard.&nbsp; An experimental import of <a href="http://www.d20srd.org">SRD skills</a> is already up and running, so it won't be long before shard supports the rest of PCGen's LST files.<br /></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size: 10px; text-align: right;">technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/java" rel="tag">java</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/shard" rel="tag">shard</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/d20" rel="tag">d20</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pcgen" rel="tag">pcgen</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></div>
