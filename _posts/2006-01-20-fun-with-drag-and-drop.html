<p>It's amazing how the little things can really make a difference for an application.  I found myself becoming annoyed when I had to import a PCGen dataset because the Java file chooser would forget the directory location after every restart of the application.  I usually have a file browser open with the PCGen files anyways, and that's when the lightbulb came on.  Now, instead of having to continually navigate with the crappy Java file chooser, I can just drag and drop the PCGen dataset I'm working with right into shard.  The implementation was pretty easy, and it adds an extra bit of polish to the application.</p><br /><br /><p>The one problem I had while implementing this new feature was that drag/drop is not supported on all operating systems the same way.  So much for <i><b>Write Once, Run Anywhere</b></i>.  =)  There is a <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4899516">documented bug that's been around since JDK 1.4 that Sun has not fixed that prevents Linux applications from handling drag/drop of files the same as other operating systems</a>.  The <a href="http://www.javadesktop.org/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=128233">work around</a> is not difficult, and it's not much of a "hack" either.  It's more of an inconvenience and frustration point.  It took me about 2 hours to figure out why the standard drag/drop tutorials from Sun was not working in my application.  I don't know how Sun can let these issues slide through the cracks...</p><br /><br /><p>Sometimes Swing programming is more fun than web programming.  Sometimes it's not.  <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe/?anchor=wicket_drag_drop_components">Drag and drop with wicket</a> was a blast, while drag and drop for Swing has kindof left a bad taste in my mouth.</p><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/java" rel="tag">java</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/swing" rel="tag">swing</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/shard" rel="tag">shard</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></div>
