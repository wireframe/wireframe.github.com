<p>Well, it's official.  I've removed all XDoclet2 dependencies from my project (Good riddence!), and I am now writing hibernate configuration files by hand.  I might look into the <a href="http://www.binamics.com/hibernatesync/">Hibernate Synchronizer</a> eclipse plugin to see if it's worth while, but I doubt it.  It looks like your code has to extend a common base class, and I'm not going to compromise my code's design to support some tool.</p></div>
