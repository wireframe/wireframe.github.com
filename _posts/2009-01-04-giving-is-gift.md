NOT an obligation.
   
   
It is such a blessing to be a part of the work that God is doing here on earth.
   
   
Why do so many organizations guilt people into giving instead of focusing on the JOY that comes from it?
   
   
It's a problem of transparency.  People can not rejoice in good that their gifts do if they don't know what their giving is actually doing.
