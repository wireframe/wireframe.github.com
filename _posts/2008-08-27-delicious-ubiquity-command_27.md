Now with 100% more AJAX!
------------------------

I couldn't resist spending some more time with Ubiquity after yesterdays exciting release.  My [first version of a delicious bookmarking command]({% post_url 2008-08-26-ubiquity-is-like-crack_26 %}) worked, but it definitely wasn't flashy.  This was a perfect opportunity to learn the [JQuery javascript library](http://jquery.com/) for AJAX interactions.  I'm quite pleased with how it's turned out.

The new version posts the current page to delicious using ajax and posts whatever tags you type into the preview panel.  Feedback and error handling is _much_improved, and it will automatically prompt you for your delicious username/password on first use (just like the twitter integration).  I've already been using it personally for posting my bookmarks and it's amazing how intuitive this tool is.  I don't think I'll ever go back.  The official delicous bookmarklet and even the slick delicous firefox extension pale in comparison since it requires _evil_ mouse interaction! 



I've published my Ubiquity command on [github](http://www.github.com), and hopefully it'll find a way onto the [official Ubiquity Herd](https://labs.toolness.com/ubiquity-herd/) sometime in the future.  In the meantime, I'd love to hear feedback or ideas for improvement!  Feel free to fork my version, and tweak it to your hearts content!



You can download the command directly from github at [http://gist.github.com/7516](http://gist.github.com/7516%20) or just copy this command into your command editor. Ubiquity can also auto-detect changes to the latest version if you subscribe to the command using [this link](http://gist.github.com/7516.txt).
