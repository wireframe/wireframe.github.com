<p>I finished adding two new pieces to <a href="http://ryan.codecrate.com">my website</a> this weekend.</p><br /><br /><p>First, I integrated <a href="http://del.icio.us/wireframe">my delicious bookmarks</a> using the <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/linkrolls">linkroll javascript</a> posted on delicious.  It's a very robust API with lots of options (specific tags, restrict number of results, etc), and has very good CSS options as well.</p><br /><br /><p>And I finally uploaded some <a href="http://ryan.codecrate.com/music">sample music</a> from the <code>drifting North</code> CD.  I've been meaning to do this for a <em>long</em> time, and I figured now was a good time to try out <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>.  Now, I've just got to figure out a distribution channel for selling CD's.  For now, anyone interested can contact me directly, and I'll get one in the mail ASAP.  I was pretty impressed that delicious even offers some custom javascript for <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/playtagger">playing mp3's on your site</a> as well!</p><br /><br /><p>Just a few more signs that you can pull off some cool <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe/?anchor=more_dynamic_for_your_static">dynamic content for static sites</a>.</p></div>
