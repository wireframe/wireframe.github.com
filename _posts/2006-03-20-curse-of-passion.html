<p>For the most part, <em>passion</em> is a great thing.  It's a word associated with <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=passion">fervor, fire and zeal</a>.  As a software developer, passion is what keeps me going.  It's what pushes me to innovate, invent and create the best possible solution for the problem at hand.  If I were forced to describe myself, I think I would choose, <em>A Passionate Opensource Software Developer</em>.</p><br /><br /><p>The flip side is that passion can drive you to the brink of insanity, if you let it.  Many a night have I burnt the midnight oil implementing <em>just one more feature</em>.  The same thing happens when I feel like a project is slipping behind or not going as smoothly as I would like.  I over-analyze the situation, and look for any way to get back on track.  More than once, this has led me into some pretty controversial situations.  I haven't been afraid to tell people blatently when I think they're wrong, or when a process is broken and needs to be changed.  </p><br /><br /><p>Some might consider this arrogance, but I expect people to be passionate for their work.  You've got to be confident if you really believe you're right.</p><br /><br /><p>Last week I started work on a project I would dub <em>The Worst Project I've Worked On In The Past Two Years</em>.     It's essentially taking everything I just learned from the amazing <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/"><em>Getting Real</em> book by 37signals</a> and throwing it right out the window.  Meeting after meeting, with no end in sight.  No clear definition or <em>vision</em> of what we're trying to attain.  Constant speculation about what the user <em>wants</em> instead of just building it and listening to their feedback.  I can't count the number of times I've wanted to impale myself with my pen while sitting through hour after hour of meeting.</p><br /><br /><p>Yes, passion can be a great thing, but there are definitely times when I wish I could <em>turn it off</em>.  It would be great to be like the mindless drones around me once and a while.  It'd be nice to not care how bad a project is, and to ignore the terrible code other people are writing.  Unfortunately, passion is not just a switch you can turn on or off whenever you want.</p></div>
