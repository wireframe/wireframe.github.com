<p>It's been a long time coming, but I'm finally posting about my recent experience at the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=106">No Fluff, Just Stuff conference</a>.This was my first time at an NFJS conference, and overall it was well worth the weekend.</p><br /><br /><p>A few common themes seemed to permeate the show...</p><br /><br /><h2>JSF</h2><br /><p>Seriously?&nbsp; People are still using this stuff?&nbsp; Damn, maybe the Java community is in worse shape than I thought.&nbsp; Legions of developers using tools simply because they believe in Ivory Tower standards.&nbsp; I was tempted more than once to join a JSF session just to pitch Wicket.&nbsp; I ran into one other Wicket-eer at NFJS and hopefully next year will have a much larger group if the <a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/community-meetups.html">Twin Cities Wicket User Group</a> starts up.<br /><br /><h2>Agile</h2><br /><p>Everyone and their mother's uncle is doing Agile.&nbsp; Finally, there are no more Agile vs. Waterfall debates.&nbsp; Test Driven Development is standard practice.&nbsp; Lots of people asking, "How can we do Agile <i>better</i> and take it to the next level?"&nbsp; That's one of the most powerful tenets of Agile...iterations.&nbsp; <i>Everything</i> is a work in progress, including your development methodology.&nbsp; Interesting presentations revolved around gathering metrics for Agile projects and how to build <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe/?anchor=running_code_doesn_t_lie">Self Describing Systems</a> to avoid unnecessary documentation.</p><br /><br /><h2>Performance</h2><br /><br /><p>Java developers are in <b>real</b> trouble here.&nbsp; Let me elaborate...</p><br /><br /><p>At least 90% of the developers in the Enterprise Application Performance session are building web apps, <b>but</b> we spent 2 hours basically talking about database tuning.&nbsp; HELLO!?!?&nbsp; Have these people been trapped in some kind of alternate universe for the past year?&nbsp; <i>Yes</i>, tuning your backend system is important, but not a single person in that room had heard of how important <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529307/">management of your web resources is</a> to the perceived performance of your application!&nbsp; It's sad that "Enterprise" Java developers don't have the slightest idea how to build <i>fast </i>webapps.</p><br /><br /><p>Another important part of performance for Java applications is understanding the JVM.&nbsp; Understanding the JVM internals is something that <b>every</b> Java developer should be forced to understand, especially garbage collection.&nbsp; There were a few <i>excellent</i> sessions for understanding Java under the hood.</p><br /><br /><p>Overall, the conference was great, and I would highly recommend it to anyone else.  Hopefully next time around they'll have a session or two about Wicket!  =)</p></div>
