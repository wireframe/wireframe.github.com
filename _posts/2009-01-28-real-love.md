A old man and woman have been married for fifty years and love each other very much.  Every evening they eat toast for supper.  The toaster they own is a real junker and always burns one piece while leaving the other piece uncooked.
   
   
Now, the old man loves burnt toast, but every evening he eats the untoasted bread thinking to himself that his wife would enjoy the piece of burnt toast.

This is real love...
