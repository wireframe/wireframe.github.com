<p>The recording industry has long held musicians in the palm of their hands, and have succeeded in making millions upon millions from other people's talent.  With the advent of the internet and more specifically Peer to Peer networks, the recording industry's precious business model has been threatened.  One way for bands to break out of the recording industry and still keep their heads above water is to offer something different.  CD sales has never been where musicians were able to make money, since the recording's were mainly owned by the recording companies.  Instead, touring and ticket sales is where the real money is found.</p><br /><br /><p>So, what if there was a way to cut into the recording industries cash flow and reap the benifits from the live gigs?  Bands such as Pearl Jam and Phish, have an increasingly popular answer.  Selling live recordings from the shows not only incurages more fans to view the shows, it also gives incentive for personal keepsakes for people to remember the shows from.</p></div>
