<p>The common Swing components created by <a href="http://common.l2fprod.com">l2fprod.com</a> just accepted the code I wrote recently to <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe/?anchor=integrate_jtaskpane_with_spring_rcp">integrate Spring-RCP with JTaskPane</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>I was <a href="http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=21867">contacted last week by Frederic</a>, the core developer for the l2fprod project, to try and collaborate on the spring-rcp integration.  All of my code was written under the ASL 2.0 license, so he was able to <a href="https://l2fprod-common.dev.java.net/source/browse/l2fprod-common/src/java/springrcp/com/l2fprod/common/springrcp/">migrate my code directly into his project</a> really quickly.</p><br /><br /><p>Since Frederic is <i>much</i> more knowledgable about the JTaskPane component, he was able to add a few new features as well.  He also published a <a href="http://common.l2fprod.com/articles/taskpane-springrcp.php">new tutorial on how to use the components</a>, which should be a big help to get people up and going.</p><br /><br /><p>Last night, I pulled down the <a href="http://common.l2fprod.com/download.php">newest snapshot</a> of the common l2fprod components, and integrated it into <a href="http://shard.codecrate.com">shard</a>.  I only had to change the class imports and the spring xml file to use the new components.  It was almost <i>too</i> easy...</p><br /><br /><p>This is a big win in my book.  I removed my custom code, and having it published by the l2fprod project, there's a much greater chance that others will use this code.  It just goes to show how powerful opensource development can really be.</p><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags begin --><br /><p style="font-size: 10px; text-align: right;">technorati tags: <br /><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/java" rel="tag">java</a>, <br /><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/swing" rel="tag">swing</a>,<br /><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/spring" rel="tag">spring</a>,<br /><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/rcp" rel="tag">rcp</a>,<br /><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/shard" rel="tag">shard</a><br /></p><br /><!-- technorati tags end --></div>
