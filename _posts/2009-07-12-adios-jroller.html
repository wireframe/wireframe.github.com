I've talked about migrating off of JRoller for a <i>long </i>time, and the time has finally come. &nbsp;The new home for this blog is officially at:<br /><a href="http://blog.codecrate.com/">http://blog.codecrate.com</a><br /><br />Unfortunately, there's no good way to migrate blog entries between systems, so my old blog will stay up in an "archived" state at <a href="http://jroller.com/wireframe">http://jroller.com/wireframe</a> from here on out. &nbsp;You'd think with all of the standardization on RSS and Atom that it would be relatively simple to migrate posts (I'm not concerned with migrating comments). &nbsp;I've tested out various <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-blog-converters-appengine/wiki/BloggerExportTemplate">atom export/import hacks</a>&nbsp;with no luck thus far.<br /><br />The focus of this blog will remain primarily the same. &nbsp;Technology is in my blood, so there will continue to be regular posts about programming, software development, testing, etc. &nbsp;In addition, I will be expanding my posts to include a little bit more about myself and personal interests. &nbsp;We'll see where it goes and I welcome any feedback.<br /><br />Anyone subscribed to the feedburner RSS feed should automatically be updated to the new blog location.</div>
