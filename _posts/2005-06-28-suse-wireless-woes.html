<p>I have now spent three days trying to upgrade my wife's computer from SuSE 9.1 to SuSE 9.3.  I was hoping that the setup of my wireless USB adapter would go smoother than <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe/20050425#suse_9_1_usb_wireless">last time</a> but, I'm sad to say that 9.3 is actually much worse.</p><br /><br /><p>My hopes were high when I first plugged in my USB adapter.  Yast instantly recognized and installed drivers, and for about 5-10 minutes all was right in the world.  I should have known that it was too easy, and wouldn't last.  After about 10 minutes, my system locked up and was completely unresponsive.  A hard shutdown was the only solution, and after the system rebooted, it would run for about 5 minutes more before locking up again.  <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/archive/41/2005/05/2/315331">Seems like all atmel usb cards lock up in SuSE 9.3</a>.  All sources point to <a href="http://lists.suse.com/archive/suse-amd64/2005-Apr/0152.html">these problems being with 9.3</a>, since the same adapters worked with 9.1 and 9.2.  </p><br /><br /><p>A bit of googling suggested trying to configure the USB adapter to use the original Windows drivers and emulate them under Linux using <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sf.net">ndiswrapper</a>.  Several hours later, I was no closer to a solution.</p><br /><br /><p>After jumping through hoops to try and get my Belkin adapter to work, I decided my time would be better spent elsewhere.  Since I run Linksys networking equipment for my house, I bought a Linksys WUSB11v4 Adapter in hopes that it would be better supported.  My assumption that Linksys would be easier, was sorely mistaken.  </p><br /><br /><p>For starters, the Linksys was not even recognized by Yast.  Several forums recommended installing <a href="http://at76c503a.berlios.de/">the berilios driver</a>, but <a href="http://at76c503a.berlios.de/devices.html">the driver only supports version 2.1, 2.6 and 2.8</a>, which does me a <i>lot</i> of good.  I don't exactly find it comforting when the driver everyone is told to install, is almost 2 versions behind released hardware.  In fact, <a href="http://forum.netgem.com/viewtopic.php?t=2650&start=10&sid=95d387067551ab63a832045f11482451">some people have recommended buying the older adapters off eBay</a> to get around this problem.  I forged ahead and tried the driver anyways to no avail.</p><br /><br /><p>Needless to say, I will be reinstalling, <i>for the seventh time</i>, with SuSE 9.2 tonight.  It looks like <a href="http://nixdoc.net/files/forum/about41079.html">one person appears to have gotten around this issue</a>, but with no documentation posted, I'm not messing around with it.</p></div>
