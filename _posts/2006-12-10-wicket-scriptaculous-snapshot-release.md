[Wicket](http://www.wicketframework.org) and [Scriptaculous](http://script.aculo.us/) are two fantastic libraries and they work extremely well together. Over the past several months, I've continued to integrate the scriptaculous Javascript library into Wicket with **lots** of success. Today, marks a significant milestone with the first availble public release! This may be a snapshot release, but it is ready for real world use.



I'll be detailing a bunch of the recent changes over the next couple posts, but until then, [download it](http://maven.codecrate.com/wicket-stuff/wicket-contrib-scriptaculous/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/wicket-contrib-scriptaculous-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) and try it for yourself!
