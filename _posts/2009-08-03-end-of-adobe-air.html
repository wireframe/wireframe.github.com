<img border="0" src="http://img.skitch.com/20090804-ghx28gb8h8td2s3y2k2qqdni6b.jpg" /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">I have a dream where our developer children will hear the name "Adobe" and not cringe.  I can see a day where we won't need proprietary and hacky plugins to solve our most basic web application (and rich desktop) needs.  HTML5 is the light on the horizon and Google is her knight in shining armor.</span><br /><br />I've built my fair share of cross platform desktop applications in Java, and over the past several months, I've built a fairly successful AIR app.  I have no doubt that it was the right decision at the time the project started, but I wouldn't make the same choice again.  The Adobe AIR platform's days are numbered, and here's why...<br /><br />AIR claims to be the perfect solution for both Flash/Flex developers <b>and</b> HTML/CSS developers.  Unfortunately, that's a load of crap and any web developer that has tested the waters with the AIR platform knows that it's only good for one thing, <b>Twitter clients</b>.  AIR is 100% geared towards Flash/Flex developers and the HTML/CSS/Javascript API's are a bolt-on hacked into the SDK.  The amount of information available for developing HTML/CSS/Javascript applications using AIR is laughable at best.  Nearly every article of documentation/forums/blogs refer to the Flex API's and it's an exercise for the reader to reverse engineer the Javascript API (if even possible). <br /><br />My very "scientific" research shows that nearly 15 ka-jillion webpages that have been built over the past 10 years.  To say the least, web technologies have proven insanely successful and the number of developers that are familiar with HTML/CSS/Javascript technologies is ridiculous. By comparison, there are roughly 5 million Java developers, 3 million .NET developers and 2 million Flash developers.  Adobe is targeted at Flash/Flex developers, Sun is pushing Java FX and Microsoft is promoting Silverlight as the rich desktop solution.  That leaves a <b>huge</b> open market of web developers with the skillset needed to apps with HTML/CSS/Javascript technologies.  <a href="http://titaniumapp.com/">Titanium</a> is emerging as the current market leader, and Google will be entering into this market very soon with the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">Google Chrome OS</a>.<br /><br />The web browser has already proven to be the best cross-platform runtime environment and Webkit has become the de-facto standard for embedded browsers.  You'd think that using Webkit with AIR would be a good thing.  Unfortunately, the version of Webkit packaged with AIR is stripped down and makes even simple things like customizing the scrollbars impossible.  Adobe had an opportunity to really push browser rendering forward by embracing HTML Canvas, but instead they've done a wonderful job at crippling the browser environment in such a way to force developers to use Flex/Flash to build visually compelling applications.<br /><br />The Adobe AIR security model has literally put me at my wits end.  From sandboxing to certificate signing, I can't count the number of number of grey hairs on my head due to the ridiculous restrictions of the AIR SDK.  My question is why put such extreme handcuffs on the developer?  If something is technically feasible, why put in *extra* development work to restrict the SDK API's?  A sandboxed environment makes sense on the web, but not for distributed desktop applications.  The majority of popular AIR applications use self signed certificates, but this is taboo according to Adobe in an effort to push purchasing potentially expensive code-signing certificates.  Signed applications are important, but whenever I install any application, I need to trust the developer regardless of the signed certificate.<br /><br />Hell, all I want from a desktop SDK is the ease of auto-updating clients as if I was deploying a website.  <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/thread/462791">AIR can't seem to get that right either</a>...<br /><br />HTML5 has the very real opportunity to give web developers the API's needed to build great rich desktop applications without proprietary components.  Audio/Video and filesystem API's will give web developers a real chance to build kick ass stuff.  Browser extensions like Greasemonkey and Google Gears have proven the technology stack is viable, and we've seen the iPhone and Palm Pre's SDK's successfully leverage these technologies.  Now, we need to push this stack onto <b>every</b> desktop.  Waiting for HTML5 capable browser marketshare to reach end users is not realistic, but providing bundled desktop apps with HTML5 embedded browsers seems like a very real solution in today's market.</div>

@Ryan:  After 3+ years, has the runtime gotten any better? I hear the documentation for HTML/JS built apps is still sparse.</div>

Hi Ryan, <br /><br />My name is Rob Christensen and I am a product manager on the Adobe AIR team. First, I wanted to say thank you for sharing your thoughts on AIR. Constructive feedback challenges us to work even harder and meet the expectations of developers building on AIR. Two, I wanted to make sure you and readers of your blog are aware that we have and continue to invest in making HTML/JavaScript development in AIR even easier. You are also right that there are a huge number of JavaScript developers in the world the world and that number continues to grown (that is also true for Flex/ActionScript developers as well). <br /><br />* Leading development tools such as Dreamweaver and Aptana provide support for building AIR applications. With these tools a JavaScript developer does not need to learn Flash to build and AIR application. There have been some amazing applications on AIR powered by HTML/JavaScript including Queued, a Netflix movie manager from Sitepen. The team posted the source code as well. See: http://sitepen.com/labs/queued/ <br /><br />* The frameworks we include inside of AIR can be used by JavaScript developers as well as ActionScript developers. We have even ported some of those libraries from Flex/ActionScript to JavaScript. We strive to provide JavaScript developers both the tooling and frameworks they need (not that we cannot do better). <br /><br />* Our help includes documentation designed specifically for JavaScript developers including Quick Start applications (with source code), developer guides, etc. See: http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/air/ -- That said, we can do better. If you have specific suggestions, please response back. <br /><br />* The next version of AIR will include a significantly improved version of WebKit. In addition to new HTML5/CSS3 features coming to AIR, there will also be performance improvements. There are many exciting features coming to HTML5/CSS3 and AIR will allow HTML/JavaScript developers to build even more sophisticated applications using these technologies for apps that need to run outside of the browser. AIR provides many hundreds of additional API&#39;s that are not a part of HTML5. Remember that applications that run outside of the browser are not limited to the browser sandbox and can take advantage of additional capabilities of the local hardware, OS, etc. I believe HTML/CSS3 developers will actually be very attracted to AIR for certain classes of applications. AIR also provides a consistent rendering engine so developers will not have to worry as much about different implementations of HTML5 and CSS3 across different browser vendors.<br /><br />It would be great to hear back from you how we could do better. I would also like to understand some of your frustrations around our security model as well. Our team is listening and we&#39;d like to know what we can do to when you back. :) <br /><br />Thank you, <br />-Rob<br />Adobe AIR Team</div>

You bring up some valid points... but there are some important details in the HTML 5 spec that need some treatment...<br /><br />4.8.10.14 Security and privacy considerations<br />The main security and privacy implications of the video and audio elements come from the ability to embed media cross-origin. There are two directions that threats can flow: from hostile content to a victim page, and from a hostile page to victim content.<br /><br />This sounds an awful lot like the foundation for a sandbox... I mean, at some point an HTML 5 developer might want to aggregate content.. no? ...and on the same hand be able to prevent malicious activity? The spec includes a number of these &#39;security&#39; entries without any kind of detail / mechanisms on how the problem is going to get solved. I&#39;m sure that the path isn&#39;t going to be all roses and fairy dust especially for early adopters. Then there is the canvas...<br /><br />4.8.11.3 Security with canvas elements<br />&quot;Information leakage can occur if scripts from one origin can access information from images from another origin.&quot;<br /><br />Protected contexts? Sounds a little like application domains; interesting. There are more entries like these and each parallel security elements in Flash very closely; I don&#39;t think that this is by accident. The really sobering bit of the spec is summed up in section 3.2.2...<br /><br />&quot;User agents must raise a SECURITY_ERR exception...&quot;<br /><br />User agents? or in other words - the browser - is going to have to deal with all the security issues? Exception handling? Wow - that&#39;s all I can say is... WOW! Is there any chance that IE, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Web Kit, Konqueror, Chrome (gasps for breath), Flock, and all the others are going to agree on a single security model / method? Granted there are only a few engines out there from which our cornucopia of browsers are realized from but still... the HTML 5 spec doesn&#39;t even begin to lay out a plan on how to make some of the most juicy (proposed) features happen.<br /><br />The simple reality is that there is a grundle of work to be done and it&#39;s going to take a fair amount of time before HTML 5 becomes a stable and staple technology in the developer toolbox. So, in the meantime what we have is what we have... and Adobe&#39;s offerings are pretty darn good as present.</div>

I haven&#39;t started yet developing for AIR, but I think you have a point there.<br />I&#39;m a flex developer so I&#39;ll use AIR for a bunch of projects but will take a look at titanium because I think it&#39;s promising.</div>

I&#39;ve got tons of tutorials and articles published on my blog about working with jQuery &amp; AIR:<br />http://andymatthews.net/category/AIR/<br /><br />In fact, I&#39;m focused almost solely on developing AIR using HTML and JavaScript (via jQuery). This year I&#39;ll have presented jQuery &amp; AIR topics at (hopefully) 4 conferences focused on the RIA space, and 2 of them thus far have been extremely well received.<br /><br />I don&#39;t blame you for feeling the way you do about the JS portion of the AIR SDK. It feels like a total last minute add-on, it&#39;s not well documented, and there are things that it can&#39;t do compared to Flex/Flash. But, remember that you can access AS3 libraries from within JS AIR apps by using the Flex/AJAX bridge. It&#39;s not perfect, but it helps.</div>

So if Adobe AIR could deploy a more complete HTML5 browser, you&#39;d be more happy to use it?  I agree that the HTML capabilities of AIR seem a little limited - would more documentation on it help, or is there something else wrong with the idea of deploying HTML apps through AIR?</div>

I just developed an Adobe AIR application using JavaScript and HTML to run a photo slideshow full screen.<br /><br />You&#39;re right, it was difficult to get up to speed using JavaScript and the documentation and tutorials on the web are incredibly biased towards Flex. <br /><br />That said, once I got the hang of it I was able to deliver something that works pretty well and is fairly easy to distribute (I am self signing the code because it&#39;s not a public application). I didn&#39;t look at Titanium because I wasn&#39;t sure about it&#39;s longevity.</div>
