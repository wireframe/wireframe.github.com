<div class='post'>
<p>For the love of God, will someone <i>please</i> create a Java version of an application launcher ala Quicksilver?!?</p><br /><br /><p>I've come to absolutely rely on these tools and it annoys me to no end that I have to install different tools and deal with different configurations for every operating system I work on (Windows, Linux KDE, Linux Gnome, and sometimes Mac).  Seriously, do we really need thirty implementations of the same idea (<a href="http://launchy.net">Launchy</a>, <a href="http://www.humanized.com/enso/">Enso</a>, Quicksilver, <a href="http://do.davebsd.com/">Gnome Do</a>, <a href="http://katapult.kde.org/">Katapult</a>)?</p><br /><br /><p>With so many opensource implementations, a Java port seems inevitable.  I'd <i>personally</i> be willing to by someone a beer if they can create a workable opensource Java version!  =)</p><br /><br /></div>
