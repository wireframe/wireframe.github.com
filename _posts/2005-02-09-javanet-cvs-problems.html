<p>Have any other java.net project owners noticed that the version of CVS used to host projects has some issues?  I ran headlong into an issue that has prevented me from integrating CVS commit messages into my <a href="http://jira.codecrate.com">JIRA instance</a>.  The underlying problem is that you can not run an r* commands against the java.net CVS servers (ex: rlog, rdiff, etc).</p><br /><p>I first went to Atlassian and opened an <a href="http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-5759">issue</a>, thinking this was a problem with JIRA.  The <i>extremely</i> prompt and helpful Atlassian people pointed me to <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-cvs/2003-09/msg00168.html">some information</a> describing this as a bug with the CVS server.  It just so happens that java.net is using this outdated version of the CVS server.  The bug is scheduled to be fixed in the <a href="https://ccvs.cvshome.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=142 ">next version of CVS</a>, but my question is, when will java.net update their servers? </p><br /><p>I did find that there is a bit of a <a href="https://java-net.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=31">workaround</a> for this problem.  Instead of using the symbolic links to the CVS repository, you can use the literal path.  This is a bit more fragile, but should work for now.  Instead of using <i>:pserver:guest@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs</i>, use <i>:pserver:guest@cvs.dev.java.net:/shared/data/ccvs/repository</i>.</p></div>
