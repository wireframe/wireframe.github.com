<p>After finishing up work on the <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe/?anchor=choice_is_good">autocomplete text field</a>, I've spent the last few weeks trying to figure out what AJAX component to implement in Wicket next.  <a href="">Scriptaculous</a> has some great demos of drag/drop and it definately has some cool use cases, so I think I'll delve into this area next.</p><br /><br /><p>I've already figured out how to <i>drag</i> images around using scriptaculous, but I have a feeling that handling the <i>drop</i> may be fairly difficult.  My <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/wicket-stuff/wicket-contrib-scriptaculous/src/java/wicket/contrib/scriptaculous/dragdrop/">first stab at creating a DraggableImage</a> is fairly simplistic, but it works for now.  Once I figure out how to drop images onto an area, I'll come back to improve the DraggableImage.  I've checked in this basic DraggableImage and <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/wicket-stuff/wicket-contrib-scriptaculous-examples/src/java/wicket/contrib/scriptaculous/examples/dragdrop">a new example has been added to wicket-stuff</a> to demonstrate its current functionality.</p></div>
