<p>Infoworld has a great article that lays out <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/11/19/47FEtop20_1.html">The top 20 IT mistakes to avoid</a>.  My absolute favorite in this article is number 16, <b>Clinging to prior solutions</b>.  With it's real world example that closely mirrors my own experience, it articulately describes the idiocy in blindly using a solution just because it's been done before.  </p><br /><br /><p>I have seen that this mentality is especially true when moving from one form of development to another.  Manager X might say, <i>"<a href="http://www.oracle.com">Company A</a> was our way of life in the <a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/developmentintegration/powerbuilder">client server world</a>, so we must use their unproven track record for N-Tier development.  They may be slower to market, and be playing catch up to the other industry leaders, but we'll simply stick with them, and not rock the boat."</i>  Inevitably, this approach will fail.  Why?  Because you can not simply force solutions that worked before into a new environment without taking into consideration how the new environment <i>should</i> work.  It could very well be that <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Company A</a> does not fully understand the environment you are migrating into, and thus you will be stuck with a <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/wireframe/20040712#the_oracle_foolset">mish-mash of technologies</a> and be worse off than sticking with your old solution.</p><br /><br /><p>Whether it is changing technologies or moving into a new field of interest, it is foolish to try and simply apply old tricks to a new strategy.</p></div>
