At my last job, I was a strong supporter of using an issue tracking system to help coordinate bug fixes and features. The projects were internal only, and since I'm a big opensource nut, I pushed to use [scarab](http://scarab.tigris.org) as our issue tracking server. The supported features were adequate, and the speed wasn't horrible, so life was good.


Now that I've established several open source projects of my own, I decided to give [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com) a try. It didn't take me long to see that JIRA is hands down the best software out there for issue tracking. I got [my instance](http://jira.codecrate.com) up and running in a matter of minutes, and haven't had to touch it since. Plain and simple, this software rocks!


Since development on scarab seems to have come to a screetching halt, I wonder how many people out there are moving to commercial issue tracking software, or if there are other good opensource solutions? And I don't want to hear anyone mention Bugzilla!
