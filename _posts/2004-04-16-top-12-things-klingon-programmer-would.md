  - 12. Specifications are for the weak and timid!
  - 11. This machine is a piece of GAGH! I need dual Pentium processors if I am
   
to do battle with this code!
  - 10. You cannot really appreciate Dilbert unless you've read it in the
   
original Klingon.
  - 9. Indentation?! -- I will show you how to indent when I indent your skull!
  - 8. What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software 'releases'.
   
Our software 'escapes' leaving a bloody trail of designers and quality
   
assurance people in its wake.
  - 7. Klingon function calls do not have 'parameters' -- they have 'arguments'
   
-- and they ALWAYS WIN THEM.
  - 6. Debugging? Klingons do not debug. Our software does not coddle the weak.
  - 5. I have challenged the entire quality assurance team to a Bat-Leth
   
contest. They will not concern us again.
  - 4. A TRUE Klingon Warrior does not comment his code!
  - 3. By filing this SPR you have challenged the honor of my family. Prepare to
   
die!
  - 2. You question the worthiness of my code? I should kill you where you
   
stand!
  - 1. Our users will know fear and cower before our software. Ship it! Ship it,
   
and let them flee like the dogs they are!
