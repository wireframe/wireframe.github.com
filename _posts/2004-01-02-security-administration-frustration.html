<p><br />Let me just say that I'm frustrated at the plethora of different <br />security infrastructures that exist in my environment and their apparent <br />lack of interoperability. For starters, I'll list the number <br />of different accounts I have to deal with on a daily basis:<br /></p><br /><ul><li><p><br />1 Windows NT account</p><br /></li> <li><p><br />2 seperate Linux accounts</p><br /></li> <li><br /><p>1 intranet account to access internal applications</p><br /></li> <li><br /><p>1 Issue Tracking account (<a href="http://scarb.tigris.org">scarab</a>)</p><br /></li> <li><br /><p>1 Reporting system account (<a href="http://oreports.sf.net">openreports</a>)</p><br /></li> <li><br /><p>7 seperate database accounts</p><br /></li> </ul><br /><p><br />I can't imagine the total cost of supporting this infrastructure, but it <br />has to be immense. Not to mention that managing this many accounts leads <br />to a complete lack of security. There's no possible way for me to keep <br />up with changing all of these passwords every 3 months like I should.<br /></p><br /><p><br />The most frustating aspect to this setup to me is the inability to get <br />our internal applications to work with Scarab and Openreports. I've <br />developed a suite of internal applications that use JAAS to provide <br />independance accross any account management system (LDAP, DB, etc), and <br />it has worked EXTREMELY well. Scarab and Openreports install their own <br />set of users/roles and all security checks are done outside of a JAAS <br />configuration.<br /></p><br /><p><br />The question remains why would a server side Java application not use <br />container managed security? SAML and the <a href="http://www.projectliberty.org"><br />Liberty Alliance</a> are still on the horizon and promise to allow these <br />desparate systems to work together somehow, but until that time, why do <br />we keep reinventing the wheel?  There is an obvious need for Java open <br />source account management software.  Does anything exist?<br /></p></div>
