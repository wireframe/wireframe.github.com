<div class='post'>
<p>I've been putting in a fair amount of work lately on two spring-rcp applications for <a href="http://shard.codecrate.com">shard</a>.  One is for managing all customizable d20 data, and the other is a character generator.  Shard is built using maven, and since spring-rcp does not have any published artifacts (or snapshots), it's been a bit of a pain to integrate the applications into my build process.</p><br /><p>To solve this problem, I decided to publish <a href="http://maven.codecrate.com/spring-rcp/jars/">CVS snapshots of spring-rcp</a> on <a href="http://maven.codecrate.com">my public maven repository</a>.  Anyone interested in developing a spring-rcp application with maven can simply update their list of repositories to include my server.  </p><br /><b>project.properties</b><br /><pre><br />#repository settings<br />maven.repo.remote=http://maven.codecrate.com,http://www.ibiblio.org/maven<br /></pre><br /><p>I've also included <a href="http://maven.codecrate.com/javahelp/jars/">other dependencies</a> that spring-rcp required to get my applications up and running.  These dependencies weren't available at <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/maven">ibiblio</a>.  If there is not a release sometime soon of spring-rcp, I may continue to publish updated CVS snapshots from time to time.</p><br /></div>
