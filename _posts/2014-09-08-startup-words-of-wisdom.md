title: "Startup Words of Wisdom"

When I began working at a startup, I remember feeling overwhelmed by
the sense of responsibility.  I was *trusted* and *empowered* to make a
difference.  Every contribution had potential to make a huge impact on such
a small company.  Talk about pressure.

Over the years, I have found these words of wisdom to be a useful tool for
improving my perspective at work and helping onboard new startup engineers.

This quote was shared with me by an amazing mentor and it dramatically changed
the way I work.  

In a startup, you can't rely on your peers or superiors to officially sanction
and bless *every* aspect of your work.  As an employee in a startup, you are
implicitly trusted to **do your job and do it well**.

Be transparent with the work you do and do *not* wait for someone else to create
a TODO list for you.

The more time you're talking, the less time you are coding.

If you *need* to have a meeting to make a decision, build a tangible
prototype first.  With a minimal investment of time, you can avoid the design by
committee scenarios and focus the discussion on "what is needed to
ship this **real** thing to production as soon as possible".

These throwaway code prototypes are extremely cheap to create and share with
coworkers thanks to tools like [git for version control](http://gitscm.org) and
[ngrok to share local development environments](http://git-scm.com/).

It is very common for new engineers to have some anxiety releasing changes to
production fearing they may have overlooked something or may unexpectedly break
something.  

Engineering at a startup is fast paced, and when you are required
to wear all the hats, it's easy to feel like you've overlooked something.  But
given the limits of time and available QA resources, **you must be
comfortable with the risk of the unknown**.

Balancing ideal state and functional state is tricky and the best advice is to
*document* a list of laundry items for your team to ensure you have visibility
into tasks that can be revisited at a later point.

Bugs **will** happen and you **will** overlook edge cases.  It's just a fact
of life in a startup.  

Shipping **known functional code with unknown bugs** still provides immense
value to the company.  At least you are learning something!  Keep your focus
on **how to mitigate and minimize risk of said bugs**.  

Leverage automated systems for monitoring, notifications and continuous
integration systems to help you keep your sanity and ensure that when problems
*do* arise, you can **detect and fix issues quickly**.

Always be open to experimentation and use data to make objective decisions for
you instead of just listening to the loudest person in the room.  

Develop a strong analytics foundation including A/B split testing and put it
into practice throughout your daily programming practice.
your codebase.

At the end of the day, all of these quotes are restating a common theme:
**Avoid bottlenecks and focus on delivering real value in your job**.  

Good luck to all you engineers out there!  Drop me a line with the quotes that
have inspired you!
