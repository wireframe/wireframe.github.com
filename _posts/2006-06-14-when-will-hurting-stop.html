<p>It's been a <em>long</em> time since I've <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe/?anchor=jsp_is_a_joke">blogged about</a> <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe/20041022#the_two_faces_of_jsp">how much I <strong>HATE</strong> JSP</a>.  Today marks yet another day in the unending saga of pain and misery, and yet another reason this beast needs to be put to sleep.</p><br /><br /><p>I seriously just spent the past two days troubleshooting why my page shows one chunk of information with correct encoding, and another piece all jumbled.  Of course, if I would have <em>known</em> it was an "encoding issue", it wouldn't have taken me so long, but that's not exactly the first place I checked since it worked for half the page.  The "Standard" JSTL import tag isn't exactly a red flag for losing the current page encoding.</p><br /><br /><p>Just to be perfectly clear why this pisses me off.  My webapp renders all pages with UTF-8 encoding (I have actually taken the time to verify that this is true for the entire application).  The <strong>problem</strong> is when you use JSTL to import common JSP fragments into your page.  JSP <em>conveniently</em> drops the current page encoding when importing the fragment.</p><br /><br /><pre>&lt;c:import charEncoding="UTF-8" url="/WEB-INF/views/jsp/myPage.jsp" /&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br /><p>I've tried a whole lot of things over the past two days to solve this issue, and every one of them proved fruitless.</p><br /><ul><li>Data setup problem.  Maybe it just looks bad for this one object?</li> <li>Data conversion/truncation issue.  If it's correct in the database, is it getting mangled somewhere else?</li> <li>Wrong tags (struts, jstl, spring).  Does JSTL have different behaviour than Struts tags?</li> </ul><br /><br /><p>Of course!  It's a JSP problem!  From this day forward, may this be a new starting point for all of my troubleshooting.  Always blame JSP first, until proven otherwise.</p><br /><br /><p>Let this blog be a testiment to the suckyness of JSP.  If you use JSP, stop using JSP.  If you can't stop using JSP, consider tossing yourself from a balcony to avoid dealing with it's suckyness.  If you wish to live, even though you work with JSP, make sure you set your encoding when using the JSTL import tag.</p><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags begin --><br /><p style="font-size: 10px; text-align: right;">technorati tags: <br /><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/java" rel="tag">java</a>, <br /><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/jsp" rel="tag">jsp</a><br /></p><br /><!-- technorati tags end --></div>
