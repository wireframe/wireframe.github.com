Incase you haven't heard, <a href="http://blog.codecrate.com/2010/02/mailinator-google-chrome-extension.html">I love</a> <a href="http://blog.codecrate.com/2009/12/delicious-google-chrome-extension.html">me some</a> Google Chrome extensions.  And now <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hpfpmhoefhblnbnipeapenjojpcbifpo/">the Zillow Google Chrome extension</a> just made looking for a new house a heck of a lot easier.<br /><br /><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100313-rcag844xg4fsk182t4xp99rp7j.jpg" /><br />Grab an address, pop open the Zillow Google Chrome extension and find the estimated property value in no time! <br /><br />The Zillow Google Chrome extension is a mashup using <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/v3/introduction.html">the Google Maps API</a> and <a href="http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/GetZestimate.htm">the Zillow API</a> to&nbsp;&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;find as much detail about a property while avoiding the cluttered and slow ass real-estate websites.  Consider this the "official" successor to my <a href="http://www.jroller.com/wireframe/entry/zillow_ubiquity_plugin">original Zillow Ubiquity plugin</a>.  Ubiquity was cool but this extension is the cat's meow!<br /><br />The Zillow Google Chrome extension shows the estimated property value along with the estimated high/low range value. &nbsp;A direct link to the detailed estimate on Zillow is also available if you want more information about the property.<br /><br />The property location is displayed with an embedded Google map along with a direct link to a full property map to dive into the street view&nbsp;(on Google Maps of course). &nbsp;Using Google's geolocation service also makes it possible to quickly find a location even if you don't know the full address!<br /><br />The <a href="http://github.com/wireframe/zillow-chrome-extension">code is 100% opensource and available on github</a>&nbsp;and here&nbsp;are a few ideas for future improvements.  fork away!<br /><ul><li>an extension browser action could detect when the user selects an address on the page</li><li>prefill the popup address based on the user selected address on the page</li><li>hovering over address could display an inline popup bubble with the estimate information</li></ul></div>
