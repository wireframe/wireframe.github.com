  1. Truly have to believe that you're making the right choicegiven the options and information at hand.
  2. Rely on a strong foundationfor your decision making. Scripture based teaching is key.
  3. Know that the outcome is in God's hands. No matter the seemingly "good" or "bad" outcome of our decision, it all works according to God's plan.
   
Romans 8:28
   
And we know that in all thingsGod works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.[(NIV)](http://christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/p/newinternationa.htm)
