<div class='post'>
<p>At my last job, I was a strong supporter of using an issue tracking system to help coordinate bug fixes and features.  The projects were internal only, and since I'm a big opensource nut, I pushed to use <a href="http://scarab.tigris.org">scarab</a> as our issue tracking server.  The supported features were adequate, and the speed wasn't horrible, so life was good.</p><br /><p>Now that I've established several open source projects of my own, I decided to give <a href="http://www.atlassian.com">JIRA</a> a try.  It didn't take me long to see that JIRA is hands down the best software out there for issue tracking.  I got <a href="http://jira.codecrate.com">my instance</a> up and running in a matter of minutes, and haven't had to touch it since.  Plain and simple, this software rocks!</p><br /><p>Since development on scarab seems to have come to a screetching halt, I wonder how many people out there are moving to commercial issue tracking software, or if there are other good opensource solutions?  And I don't want to hear anyone mention Bugzilla!</p></div>
