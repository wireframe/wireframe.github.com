<div class='post'>
<p>I ran into some confusing terminology while examining localization code; <b>i18n</b> and <b>l10n</b>.  After some Googling, I found that they refer to INTERNATIONALIZATION and LOCALIZATION respectively.  These acronyms are actually just abbreviations of the words using this form: <br/><br /><b>[FIRST_CHARACTER][NUMBER_OF_CHARACTERS_BETWEEN][LAST_CHARACTER]</b><br/><br />I even ran into someone referring to INSTALLATION as i10n.  I think this is a very bad pattern to follow in general, since most acronyms mask the relevent "Domain Language".</p></div>
