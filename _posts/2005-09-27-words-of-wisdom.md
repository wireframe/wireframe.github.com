And now for a short break from my techo blog...



There's been a lot of talk lately about [who's to blame for problems in our world](http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/27/katrina.brown/index.html). This constant bickering has pushed me too far, and so I've decided to post two simple statements that I constantly run through my head on any given day. If more people would ponder these types of statements, more time would be spent fixing problems instead of bitching about them.



"How are you going to change the world, right here, right now?"



"If you don't do it, noone else will."



This second statement is one I find especially relevent. So many American's have the mentaility that, "If you don't do it, someone else will." This ultimately leads to lazyness because if the person next to you has the same belief, it turns into a never ending chain of inaction.
