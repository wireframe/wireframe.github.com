If you don't do it, who will?
   
- Me
   
   
Valuable life lesson I've learned time and time again.  You can not leave a job undone and expect someone else to pick up the pieces.  This is very valuable to me right now because with my amazing wife working so hard, I can no longer sit idol and expect that things will magically get done.
