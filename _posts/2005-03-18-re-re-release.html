He's now planning to <a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&storyID=2005-03-18T085249Z_01_DEN830004_RTRUKOC_0_FILM-3D.xml">redo the entire Star Wars series in 3-D</a>.  It's finally official that Lucas has no integrity or talent.  How can he pander a 20 year old film every couple years as his "true and ultimate vision".</p><br /><p>I love Star Wars (No thanks to George Lucas) since Episode V: Empire Strikes Back is by <b><i>FAR</i></b> the best of the series and Lucas had little to do with its brillience.</p><br /><p>I think Obiwan said it best, <i>"It's as if a million voices all cried out in agony, and were suddenly silenced."</i>  I think I'm going to cry myself to sleep tonight...</p></div>
