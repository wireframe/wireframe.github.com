Imagine that.  Just weeks after [raving how great Flock was](http://jroller.com/page/wireframe/?anchor=p_i_think_a_href), I'm back to browsing with "good old" Firefox.  Of course, I've installed a couple of plugins to give me an equivalent suite of features.  Here's how to "pimp your Firefox" to make Flock nearly obsolete:

   
   
   
  - The [performancing firefox plugin](http://performancing.com/firefox)is a very impressive plugin and has great integration with blogging platforms.
   
   
  - [foxylicious](http://dietrich.ganx4.com/foxylicious/)is another must have plugin that actually has better [delicious](http://del.icio.us)integration than Flock.

   
   
   
I think Flock's direction is nobel (or is it just novel?).  The internet community could use a distribution of firefox that was pre-packaged with useful internet/blogging tools.
