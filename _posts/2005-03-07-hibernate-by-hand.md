Well, it's official. I've removed all XDoclet2 dependencies from my project (Good riddence!), and I am now writing hibernate configuration files by hand. I might look into the [Hibernate Synchronizer](http://www.binamics.com/hibernatesync/) eclipse plugin to see if it's worth while, but I doubt it. It looks like your code has to extend a common base class, and I'm not going to compromise my code's design to support some tool.
