<p>Okay, I KNOW I might be jumping the gun here, but I just have to say that the new <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity">Firefox Ubiquity Plugin</a> is the greatest piece of software written.&nbsp; EVER.</p><p>Well, maybe that <span style="font-style: italic;">is </span>jumping the gun a bit, but I am <span style="font-style: italic;">extremely</span> excited to see where this project goes.&nbsp; I have been very interested in language driven UI's and this is the first time I've seen such an aggressive push for enabling non-developers to write extensions.&nbsp; This could be huge.&nbsp; Just think of all the wanna be hackers out there with just a little bit of javascript experience being able to create and deploy mashups that had previously been behind developer's lock and key.</p><p>They have done an excellent job of giving you all the tools you need to succeed.&nbsp; The editor is built in.&nbsp; No SDK, no extra installation, and best of all, <span style="font-weight: bold;">dynamic reloading of your commands</span> (no restarts needed!).&nbsp; Seriously, I'm a total hack at javascript, and I was able to whip up this simple little integration with <a href="http://www.delicious.com">delicious</a> in about 20 minutes.</p><pre>CmdUtils.CreateCommand(&#123;</pre><pre>&nbsp; name: &quot;delicious&quot;,</pre><pre>&nbsp; homepage: &quot;http://ryan.codecrate.com/&quot;,</pre><pre>&nbsp; author: &#123; name: &quot;Ryan Sonnek&quot;, email: &quot;ryan@codecrate.com&quot;&#125;,</pre><pre>&nbsp; contributors: [&quot;Ryan Sonnek&quot;],</pre><pre>&nbsp; license: &quot;MIT&quot;,</pre><pre>&nbsp; description: &quot;Tags the current site using delicious&quot;,</pre><pre>&nbsp; </pre><pre>&nbsp; preview: &quot;bookmark the current url on delicious&quot;, </pre><pre>&nbsp; execute: function() &#123;</pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var document = context.focusedWindow.document;</pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var selected_text = document.getSelection();</pre><pre><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var params = Utils.paramsToString(&#123;</pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; url: document.location,</pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; title: document.title,</pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notes: selected_text</pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#125;);</pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utils.openUrlInBrowser('http://delicious.com/save'+params);</pre><pre>&nbsp; &#125;</pre><pre>&#125;)</pre><p><br /></p><p>Now we just need a <a href="http://www.github.com">github</a> repo to create these commands and fork away!<br /></p></div>
