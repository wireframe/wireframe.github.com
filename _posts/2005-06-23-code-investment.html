<p>I always knew that working on open source projects was an investment of time, but now I can see how much it would cost!  <a href="http://www.koders.com">Koders.com</a> has <a href="http://koders.com/info.aspx?c=ProjectInfo&pid=GYFTMVZ9VHGEKM6VN8P6BZ4MXF">estimated development costs for shard</a>, based on some basic formulas like: <i>LINES_OF_CODE x COST_PER_1000_LINES</i>.  To be honest, it's a little lower than what I expected.  They don't have all of the source code available yet (shard-minotaur is not there), so those numbers might increase once they have the complete project.</p><br /><p>I'll have to be careful who I show this to.  I don't think my wife was too impressed when she thought of how much I've invested in this project that could have been spent doing more freelance consulting.</p></div>
