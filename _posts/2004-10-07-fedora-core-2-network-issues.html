<div class='post'>
<p>I installed fedora core 2 about a month ago, and I am suprised to find how many network issues I am having.  Every 2-3 days I need to restart the network service (<i>/etc/init.d/network restart</i>).  I've run SuSe before without problems, so I find it hard to believe this is a hardware issue.  Is FC2 just a little flaky?</p><br /><p>I'm relying on my network being up to host webapplications, so I may have to move to another distribution soon unless I can figure out what's going on.  So far, no strange error messages have shown up to tell me what may be going wrong.</p></div>
