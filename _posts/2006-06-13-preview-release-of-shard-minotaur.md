Whew...I just wrapped up [releasing a preview of the new shard-minotaur d20 character generator application](http://wiki.codecrate.com/display/SHA/2006/06/13/Preview+Release+of+Shard+Minotaur) that I've been working on for quite a while. I've been chomping at the bit to get this app out there so that I can get feedback as early as possible.



I'm interested to see what people think about the app, even though it's extremely early. I'm not sure what user's reactions will be to an application that's "functional" yet "limited". I hate calling things an **alpha** or **beta** release, but is it necessary for users to feel comfortable using the app?



I'm still new to this whole release announcement thing and I'm not a big fan of cross posting, so I'll try to make any release postings on this blog relevant to it's audience. Anyone interested in more info about the shard RPG project can ping me or check out the [project website](http://shard.codecrate.com).
