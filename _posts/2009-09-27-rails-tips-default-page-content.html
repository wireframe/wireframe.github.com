<div class='post'>
Using Rails layouts is a great way to abstract away commonly rendered elements.  Over the past year, I have found myself creating multiple layouts which were essentially the same, and just needed to customize a portion of the content.  It's an expensive process to maintain multiple layouts, so I decided to find a more DRY approach.<br /><br />Here's a simple solution for your layouts to provide the default content, and expose an extension point to allow your templates to override with their own content.<br /><pre><br />#app/views/layouts/application.html.haml<br />%html<br /> %body<br />   #header<br />     - header = yield :header<br />     = header.blank? ? render(:partial => 'header') : header<br />   = yield<br /></pre><br />Now each of your views can "inherit" the default markup, or they can override the content by declaring a content_for block like so:<br /><pre><br />#app/views/posts/index.html.haml<br />- content_for :header do<br /> .my_special_header<br />   custom content goes here<br /></pre><br />Simple, elegant and much more maintainable!</div>
