<div class='post'>
I use <a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a>.  A LOT.<br /><br />It's one of the few web services that I have used religiously for years.  One of the main reasons I continue to use Delicious is sheer number of great integrations with their <a href="http://delicious.com/help/api">developer API</a>.  The Delicious plugin for Firefox is quite good and there is nothing&nbsp;equivalent&nbsp;available for my new default browser, Google Chrome...until now!<br /><br />I'm excited to officially announce the release of my&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/maegjfahmbklahdfelffbmnkaoicphdm">Delicious Chrome extension</a>!<br /><br /><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20091216-jrcaffr3s7dcft4mw6x57bpukp.jpg" /><br /><br />The Delicious Chrome extension adds a browser action that will save your current page as a Delicious bookmark. The extension will also show popular and recommended tags for the current page and you can add these tags to your bookmark with a simple click.<br /><br />But that's not all!  The Delicious Chrome extension also integrates with the standard Chrome bookmark stars.  Starring a page will automatically save the page on Delicious as well!  This should greatly help users add Delicious to their existing browsing behavior without having to learn a new tool.<br /><br />This extension is <a href="http://github.com/wireframe/delicious-chrome-extension">100% opensource</a> and contributions are always welcome!  Please leave any feedback here or on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/maegjfahmbklahdfelffbmnkaoicphdm">extension install page</a>.</div>
