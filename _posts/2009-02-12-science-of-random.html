How Darwinistic Evolution has survived <i><b>any</b></i> amount of scientific scrutiny is beyond me.&nbsp; At its core, any scientific theory based on randomness (ie: random genetic mutations), is no theory at all.&nbsp; In order to prove the theory, you would need to assert that randomness is indeed true and since randomness is equivalent to chaos, it is neither true nor false and can never be proven.<br /><br />Given a controlled environment, the simplest of "random" events (ex: flipping a coin) can be most assuredly "proven" to flip either heads or tails on command.&nbsp; The "randomness" that we perceive is nothing more than a list of factors that influence a given event to go one way or another (ex: wind + spin + gravity + other minute details our tiny brains can not comprehend).<br /><br />My point is that there is <i><b>no</b></i> such thing as a "random" event.&nbsp; A person who believes in a designed plan and order to life has a much more solid philosophical <b>and</b> scientific foundation for the definition of truth than the fool who believes blindly in the percieved "truth" of randomness.</div>
