I ran into some confusing terminology while examining localization code; i18n and l10n. After some Googling, I found that they refer to INTERNATIONALIZATION and LOCALIZATION respectively. These acronyms are actually just abbreviations of the words using this form:
   
   
[FIRST\_CHARACTER][NUMBER\_OF\_CHARACTERS\_BETWEEN][LAST\_CHARACTER]
   
   
I even ran into someone referring to INSTALLATION as i10n. I think this is a very bad pattern to follow in general, since most acronyms mask the relevent "Domain Language".
