<p>Let me get one thing clear: Software performance <em>is</em> important, but it's also <em>completely</em> overrated.</p><br /><br /><p>Why is it that in nearly every code inspection, the <em>first</em> comment I hear is related to performance?  Is performance somehow <em>the</em> most important software metric? Are educational institutions forcing programmers to believe that fast procedural code is all that matters?  Hell, it might be time to throw out Java for good old assembly!  I can't count the number of times I've heard something like, <i>"If I loop through this collection twice, it will be slower."</i>  So what!</p><br /><br /><p>Sure, your code <em>may</em> be faster, but will it be more <strong>clear</strong>?  More <strong>testable</strong>?  More <strong>understandable</strong>?  Give me clean <em>slow</em> code any day of the week.  In the end, your fast code doesn't matter to me unless you can <em>prove</em> that it's faster.</p><br /><br /><p><i>"Early optimization is the root of much evil."</i></p></div>
