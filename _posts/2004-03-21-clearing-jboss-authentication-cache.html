<p>I've had several headaches lately when dealing with the JBoss authentication cache.  If a user needs to change passwords, or account privilages, the cache lingers and lingers for as long as 30 min.  Luckily I ran across this webblog that posts code to clear it programatically.  I'll be sure to do something similar in my next project.<br /><a href="http://jroller.com/page/RickHigh/20040226#i_got_jboss_security_working1">http://jroller.com/page/RickHigh/20040226#i_got_jboss_security_working1</a></p></div>
