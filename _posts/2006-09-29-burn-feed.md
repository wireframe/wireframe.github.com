With my recent annoyances with the JRoller hosting, I've decided that it would be best to try and remove any unnecessary dependency on their lackluster product.  So, I've turned to [feedburner ](http://www.feedburner.com)to provide RSS subscriptions of this blog.  This will allow me to migrate off of JRoller and to another host without worrying about anyone missing posts.



So, if there's anyone out there that actually reads this blog, please update your RSS feeds to be this new url: [http://feeds.feedburner.com/code\_poet](http://feeds.feedburner.com/code_poet)



I've also updated the RSS autodetection link on the website, so anyone using built in RSS detection in the future should automatically pick up the new feed.  I would love to have automatically done the redirection for any existing readers, but since JRoller servers are "locked down", that won't be happening anytime soon.




Sorry for the inconvenience, and thanks for your interest in this blog!
