<p>I can't say that I'm exactly impressed with the folks who run JRoller.  After their latest upgrade, my templates have broken permalinks.  I originally customized my template to add <a href="http://technorati.com">technorati</a> links, but reverting to the "default" templates doesn't fix the issue.  The permalinks for each blog contains an unrendered velocity macro, <b>$entry.website.user.userName</b>.  Now, you'd expect a bug <i>this</i> noticeable to be fixed after an hour or two, but this has been lingering around for the past two months!  </p><br /><br /><p>Any good opensource project has bug trackers to work with these kinds of issues, but this isn't a problem with the <a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/page/project">roller blogging engine</a>.  JRoller's implementation is just broken, and how do they track <i>their</i> issues?  I've tried posting comments for the site owners, but that hasn't made any progress.  It's pretty much a one-way communication stream...</p><br /><br /><p>Just goes to show you that you get what you pay for.  Maybe it's finally time for me to start hosting my own blog.</p></div>
