<p>I thought I'd have a demo out sooner, but working with Java Webstart is quite a pain in the arse.</p>  <br /><br /><p>You'd think that if Sun took Java seriously for the desktop, they'd be pushing this technology a lot harder to get some decent tools out the door.  As it stands today, it's "functional" (for the most part) but it lacks polish to make it easy on developers.  This is <i>especially</i> true for the <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/webstart-maven-plugin-parent/webstart-maven-plugin/">maven webstart plugin</a>.  It has a <i>long</i> way to go before it can be used in the real world.</p><br /><br /><p>Without further ranting, I present the <a href="http://shard.codecrate.com/shard-cyclops/launch.jnlp">first available demo of the shard-cyclops application</a>.  It's a basic battle grid application that allows for moving tokens around a set of grid squares.  Obstacles can be placed on the grid to prevent movement along certain paths.</p><br /><br /><p>Try it out, and drop me a line with any comments or suggestions!</p></div>
