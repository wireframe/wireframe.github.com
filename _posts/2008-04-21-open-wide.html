<p>I feel a bit like little Joe Miller in this <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=OXc5ltzKq3Y">classic video</a>...</p><br /><br /><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/OXc5ltzKq3Y&hl=en"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/OXc5ltzKq3Y&hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object><br /><br /><p>This Wednesday will be a big day for me.  I'll be changing jobs for the first time in over four years.  I've only gone through a few job changes in my professional career, and I'm <b>very</b> excited about this new opportunity.  These are big changes in my life, and it's a bit like taking a drink from that fire hose.</p><br /><br /><p>It's time to bid farewell to the corporate world and move to a small startup company.  I'm very excited to move to a smaller company where the people are really passionate about building kick ass software.  A place where people are excited about what they do, and there are minimal roadblocks in the way of "Getting Things Done".  It may take a little time to adjust to the cultural differences between a large corporate <i>enterprise-y</i> company based in the suburbs and a small startup company in the downtown metro area, but I think I'll manage... =)</p><br /><br /><p>I've been doing Java development (client and serverside) for the past ten years, and this will be my first experience working with Ruby on Rails.  This will be a <b>HUGE</b> change.  I've talked <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe?entry=humane_object_iteration">about</a> <a href="http://www.jroller.com/wireframe/entry/static_finders_in_java">ruby</a> <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe/?anchor=ruby_syntax_for_java_maps">and</a> <a href="http://jroller.com/page/wireframe?entry=findertemplate">java</a> a number of times, and I'm excited to dig more into the ruby language to see what it has to offer.  Don't worry though; I'll still be active in the Java community, especially with Wicket.  I'm still hoping to get <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/wicket-user-group-twincities">the twin cities wicket users group</a> off the ground.  Who knows, maybe a port of wicket to ruby is in my future?  =)</p><br /><br /><p>I'll finally be able to dive into the world of apple and use a macbook pro as my primary development platform.  It feels so good for a workplace to run a <i>decent</i> operating system on their workstations (instead of crappy windows).  It will take some time to <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back">"unlearn what I have learned"</a> from the wonderful world of windows and adapt the "mac way" of doing things (especially keyboard shortcuts).  I've come across a few <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/i-switched-mac-here-are-notes">good articles</a> for apple newbies, but please share any tips/tricks you may have!</p><br /><br /><p>Oh, and I think I know someone that looks an awful lot like Stanley Spadowski! =)</p><br /><br /></div>
