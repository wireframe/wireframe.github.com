<p>With my recent annoyances with the JRoller hosting, I've decided that it would be best to try and remove any unnecessary dependency on their lackluster product.  So, I've turned to <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">feedburner </a>to provide RSS subscriptions of this blog.  This will allow me to migrate off of JRoller and to another host without worrying about anyone missing posts.</p><br /><br /><p>So, if there's anyone out there that actually reads this blog, please update your RSS feeds to be this new url: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/code_poet">http://feeds.feedburner.com/code_poet</a></p><br /><br /><p>I've also updated the RSS autodetection link on the website, so anyone using built in RSS detection in the future should automatically pick up the new feed.  I would love to have automatically done the redirection for any existing readers, but since JRoller servers are "locked down", that won't be happening anytime soon.<br/><br /></p><br /><br /><p>Sorry for the inconvenience, and thanks for your interest in this blog!<br/><br /></p><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">technorati tags:<a href="http://technorati.com/tag/rss" rel="tag">rss</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --></div>
