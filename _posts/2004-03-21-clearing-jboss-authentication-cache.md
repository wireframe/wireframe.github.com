I've had several headaches lately when dealing with the JBoss authentication cache. If a user needs to change passwords, or account privilages, the cache lingers and lingers for as long as 30 min. Luckily I ran across this webblog that posts code to clear it programatically. I'll be sure to do something similar in my next project.
