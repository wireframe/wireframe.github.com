I can't say that I'm exactly impressed with the folks who run JRoller. After their latest upgrade, my templates have broken permalinks. I originally customized my template to add [technorati](http://technorati.com) links, but reverting to the "default" templates doesn't fix the issue. The permalinks for each blog contains an unrendered velocity macro, $entry.website.user.userName. Now, you'd expect a bug this noticeable to be fixed after an hour or two, but this has been lingering around for the past two months!



Any good opensource project has bug trackers to work with these kinds of issues, but this isn't a problem with the [roller blogging engine](http://rollerweblogger.org/page/project). JRoller's implementation is just broken, and how do they track their issues? I've tried posting comments for the site owners, but that hasn't made any progress. It's pretty much a one-way communication stream...



Just goes to show you that you get what you pay for. Maybe it's finally time for me to start hosting my own blog.
