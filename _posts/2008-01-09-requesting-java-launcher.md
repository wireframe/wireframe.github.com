For the love of God, will someone please create a Java version of an application launcher ala Quicksilver?!?



I've come to absolutely rely on these tools and it annoys me to no end that I have to install different tools and deal with different configurations for every operating system I work on (Windows, Linux KDE, Linux Gnome, and sometimes Mac). Seriously, do we really need thirty implementations of the same idea ([Launchy](http://launchy.net), [Enso](http://www.humanized.com/enso/), Quicksilver, [Gnome Do](http://do.davebsd.com/), [Katapult](http://katapult.kde.org/))?



With so many opensource implementations, a Java port seems inevitable. I'd personally be willing to by someone a beer if they can create a workable opensource Java version! =)
