<p><a href="http://xwork.dev.java.net">XWork</a> is the extremely powerful action processing framework that serves as the foundation for popular projects like <a href="http://webwork.dev.java.net">WebWork</a>.  I have recently started a new project <a href="http://swingwork.dev.java.net">SwingWork</a> attempting to integrate XWork and Swing in a clean and consise way. </p><br /><p>Currently supported features include:<br /><ul><li>Action execution occurs in background thread.</li> <li>Several basic Swing containers can be used as results (JPanel, JDialog, JFrame).</li> <li>Progress bar during action execution that can be updated while action executes.</li> <li>Built in splash screen for launching applications.</li> <li>Demo application with full source code.</li> </ul><br /></p><br /><p>Action frameworks are really taking off, and I would love to hear feadback (or possible participation) from anyone interested!</p></div>
