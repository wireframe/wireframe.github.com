<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> an obligation.<br /><br />It is such a blessing to be a part of the work that God is doing here on earth.<br /><br />Why do so many organizations guilt people into giving instead of focusing on the JOY that comes from it?<br /><br />It's a problem of transparency.&nbsp; People can not rejoice in good that their gifts do if they don't know what their giving is actually doing.&nbsp;</div>
