<p>I've been a hardcore Linux user for the past couple years, and I commonly refer to Linux as <b><i>The Poor Man's Apple</i></b>.  I use Linux because I truly believe that I'm more productive using Linux than Windows, <i>and</i> I'm too cheap to buy an Apple.  Seriously, I would love to have a spiffy new Apple laptop, but I just can't justify paying the extra markup cost.</p><br /><br /><p><a href="http://opensuse.org">SuSE Linux</a> has been my distribution of choice for quite some time, but this week I decided to try out the highly recommended <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu distribution</a>.  I can honestly say that this was the easiest installation I've ever done.  It literally took me <i>5 minutes</i> to boot up and try out their live CD, and after a couple clicks and about 15 minutes of file copying, I was up and running.  The Ubuntu install went far beyond my expectations, and there were a few specific features that really blew me away.</p><br /><br /><p>Apple is known for packing a lot of "nifty" features into there operating system for a great out of the box experience, while Linux support for <i>non-free</i> applications is pretty poor.  I've grown to deal with installing "bare bones" Linux, and then tweaking it to get basic MP3 and DVD support.  Not any more!  After installing Ubuntu, I installed <a href="http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/">Easy Ubuntu</a>, and was able to get all these extensions installed in a snap!  It even installed the Java 5 JRE for me!</p><br /><br /><p>The other feature that I found especially impressive was how Ubuntu automatically created mapped drives for my commonly used connections.  I frequently need to connect to my server to transfer files, or my public ftp server to update webpages.  Ubuntu will walk you through this connection process and then create a handy desktop icon to reconnect to your network location.  Very nice!</p><br /><br /><p>Having a flashy new Apple would be nice, but I don't feel the need nearly as much now.  As Ubuntu keeps getting better, I'm quite happy to keep recieving all of these updates <i><b>for free</b></i>!</p></div>
