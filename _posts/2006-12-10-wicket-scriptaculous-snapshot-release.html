<br /><p><a href="http://www.wicketframework.org">Wicket</a> and <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a> are two fantastic libraries and they work extremely well together.  Over the past several months, I've continued to integrate the scriptaculous Javascript library into Wicket with <i><strong>lots</strong></i> of success.  Today, marks a significant milestone with the first availble public release!  This may be a snapshot release, but it is ready for <i>real world</i> use.</p><br /><br /><p>I'll be detailing a bunch of the recent changes over the next couple posts, but until then, <a href="http://maven.codecrate.com/wicket-stuff/wicket-contrib-scriptaculous/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/wicket-contrib-scriptaculous-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar">download it</a> and try it for yourself!</p></div>
