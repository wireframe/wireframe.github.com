Yep, George Lucas is at it again. He's now planning to [redo the entire Star Wars series in 3-D](http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&storyID=2005-03-18T085249Z_01_DEN830004_RTRUKOC_0_FILM-3D.xml). It's finally official that Lucas has no integrity or talent. How can he pander a 20 year old film every couple years as his "true and ultimate vision".

   
I love Star Wars (No thanks to George Lucas) since Episode V: Empire Strikes Back is by FAR the best of the series and Lucas had little to do with its brillience.

   
I think Obiwan said it best, "It's as if a million voices all cried out in agony, and were suddenly silenced." I think I'm going to cry myself to sleep tonight...
