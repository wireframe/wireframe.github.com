With the [recent release of the scriptaculous 1.8 javascript library](http://script.aculo.us/), I've [released an update to the wicketstuff-scriptaculous project](http://wicketstuff.org/maven/repository/org/wicketstuff/wicketstuff-scriptaculous/1.3-SNAPSHOT/) that incorporates these latest changes (including prototype 1.6!).



No Java API changes are in this release, so it should be a transparent upgrade for users. See the [scriptaculous release notes](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/spinoffs/scriptaculous/CHANGELOG?rev=8083) for a complete list of changes.
