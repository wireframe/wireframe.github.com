I always knew that working on open source projects was an investment of time, but now I can see how much it would cost! [Koders.com](http://www.koders.com) has [estimated development costs for shard](http://koders.com/info.aspx?c=ProjectInfo&pid=GYFTMVZ9VHGEKM6VN8P6BZ4MXF), based on some basic formulas like: LINES\_OF\_CODE x COST\_PER\_1000\_LINES. To be honest, it's a little lower than what I expected. They don't have all of the source code available yet (shard-minotaur is not there), so those numbers might increase once they have the complete project.

   
I'll have to be careful who I show this to. I don't think my wife was too impressed when she thought of how much I've invested in this project that could have been spent doing more freelance consulting.
