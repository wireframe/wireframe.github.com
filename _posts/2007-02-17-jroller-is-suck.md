I haven't been the biggest fan of JRoller, and now they've sunk to a new low, adding spam to my RSS feed. This comes at a time when JRoller might finally be getting some good press for [breaking 10,000 users](http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t59326.html).

   
   
Who the crap is DZone and why are they scamming my RSS feeds!?
   
   

   
Tired of your job? Need to hire developers? Visit DZone Jobs: great people, great opportunities.
   

   
   
Well, I'm tired of this crappy service! Time to look for a new provider. Luckily those of you subscribing to this feed using my feedburner url will not be affected by any changes. Any suggestions other than blogspot for blog hosting?

   
   
I probably wouldn't have caught this except for the fact that I subscribe to my own RSS feed, and started seeing this junk after each post. Nice try JRoller! You can't slip something like this past me!
