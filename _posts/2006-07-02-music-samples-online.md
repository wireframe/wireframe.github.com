I finished adding two new pieces to [my website](http://ryan.codecrate.com) this weekend.



First, I integrated [my delicious bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/wireframe) using the [linkroll javascript](http://del.icio.us/help/linkrolls) posted on delicious. It's a very robust API with lots of options (specific tags, restrict number of results, etc), and has very good CSS options as well.



And I finally uploaded some [sample music](http://ryan.codecrate.com/music) from the drifting North CD. I've been meaning to do this for a _long_ time, and I figured now was a good time to try out [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/). Now, I've just got to figure out a distribution channel for selling CD's. For now, anyone interested can contact me directly, and I'll get one in the mail ASAP. I was pretty impressed that delicious even offers some custom javascript for [playing mp3's on your site](http://del.icio.us/help/playtagger) as well!



Just a few more signs that you can pull off some cool
