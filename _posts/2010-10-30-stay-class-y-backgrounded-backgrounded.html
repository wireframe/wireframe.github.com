All out of the box back-ends have been updated to respect this new configuration.<br /><br />Backgrounded class methods work exactly the same as instance methods and there are no client API changes required to use them.  Just reference your class level method with a class level backgrounded declaration and you're all set.<br /><br /><pre>class User<br />  class &lt;&lt; self<br />    backgrounded :my_instance_method<br />    def my_instance_method<br />    end<br />  end<br />end<br /><br />#run the instance method in the background<br />=&gt; User.my_instance_method_backgrounded</pre><br />Sourcecode on Github.<br /><a href="http://github.com/wireframe/backgrounded">http://github.com/wireframe/backgrounded</a><br /><br />Latest gem on Gemcutter.<br /><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/backgrounded">https://rubygems.org/gems/backgrounded</a></div>
