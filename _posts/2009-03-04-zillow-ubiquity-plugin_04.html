<p>Let's face it.&nbsp; The majority of house hunting websites out there suck.&nbsp; They're slow, unusable and more often than not, make me want to put my head through a window.</p><p><a href="http://www.zillow.com">Zillow.com</a> is the first real estate website I've come across has a very compelling user experience complete with all the flashy web 2.0 features I've come to expect (especially mapping).</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't currently have the ability to manage everything I need in Zillow, so I find myself flipping back and forth from real estate listing sites into Zillow.&nbsp; I finally had enough and decided to whip up a Ubiquity command to integrate with the Zillow API.&nbsp; This allows me to keep cruising on my current website, and mash up the great estimation features of Zillow.</p><p>&nbsp;Here's how it works.</p><p>1.&nbsp; Install the <a href="http://gist.github.com/74198">Zillow Ubiquity command available on github</a>.</p><p>2. Search the web for a property that interests you.</p><p>3. Highlight the address that you want to inquire about. </p><p><img vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" align="baseline" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3584/3330327294_e10046891e.jpg" /><br /></p><p>4. Invoke the Zillow Ubiquity command.</p><p><img vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" align="baseline" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3325/3329493793_74d5739da8.jpg" />&nbsp;</p><p>Voila!&nbsp; Now you have access to the property estimated value while keeping you in the flow of browsing your current site.</p><p>&nbsp;As an added bonus, you can open up the Zillow page for that property by pressing enter on the Ubiquity preview window.</p><p><img vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" align="baseline" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3300/3329493949_8efec24e71.jpg" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One drawback of the current implementation is that the Zillow API is very picky about passing an address with a zip code.&nbsp; Ideally, I could use a mashup with google maps to decipher the zipcode without forcing the user to enter one.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be helpful!</p><p> <br /></p></div>
