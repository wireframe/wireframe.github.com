Specifications are for the weak and timid!</p></li> <li><p>11. This machine is a piece of GAGH! I need dual Pentium processors if I am<br />to do battle with this code!</p></li> <li><p>10. You cannot really appreciate Dilbert unless you've read it in the<br />original Klingon.</p></li> <li><p>9. Indentation?! -- I will show you how to indent when I indent your skull!</p></li> <li><p>8. What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software 'releases'.<br />Our software 'escapes' leaving a bloody trail of designers and quality<br />assurance people in its wake.</p></li> <li><p>7. Klingon function calls do not have 'parameters' -- they have 'arguments'<br />-- and they ALWAYS WIN THEM.</p></li> <li><p>6. Debugging? Klingons do not debug. Our software does not coddle the weak.</p></li> <li><p>5. I have challenged the entire quality assurance team to a Bat-Leth<br />contest. They will not concern us again.</p></li> <li><p>4. A TRUE Klingon Warrior does not comment his code!</p></li> <li><p>3. By filing this SPR you have challenged the honor of my family. Prepare to<br />die!</p></li> <li><p>2. You question the worthiness of my code? I should kill you where you<br />stand!</p></li> <li><p>1. Our users will know fear and cower before our software. Ship it! Ship it,<br />and let them flee like the dogs they are!</p></li> </ul></div>
