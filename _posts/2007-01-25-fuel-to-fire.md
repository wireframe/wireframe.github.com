It's funny...There are days when I enjoy my current place of work, and there are days that I'm literally a few seconds away from losing it.



Today, I raised some questions regarding processes that go against effective software development. I'm a software developer, and things that keep me from developing should be kept to a minimum, right? The response I received? "We're not a software development company. Never have been. Never will be."



Damn. Isn't that motivating? Sure, I could cave in and give up all of my lofty, idealogical development thoughts. I could wuss out and become a thoughtless drone churning out lines and lines of code. I could accept the fact that the folks in charge have no idea how software development works.



But there's a problem with that...


[I have passion for what I do](http://jroller.com/page/wireframe/?anchor=the_curse_of_passion).



I'd just like to take a moment to thank all those [no-talent-ass-clowns](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Office_Space) that have helped shape me into the person I am today. I wouldn't be always on the lookout for the next big thing if it weren't for you.



So, thank you Corporate America for belittling your employees. Thank you for encouraging marketplace innovation through disruptive channels by creating a disgruntled workforce who's only goal is to break free from the monotonous noise churned out by white collar workforces. The successful internet startup companies of the past, present and future couldn't have done it without you.
