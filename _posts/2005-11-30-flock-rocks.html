<p><a href="http://www.flock.com">Flock</a> has the potential to be one of the coolest applications of 2006.&nbsp; This is assuming, of course, a final release gets out the door next year.&nbsp; I tried out their <a href="http://downloads.flock.com/?product=flock-0.4.10&amp;os=win">first developer preview release</a>, but some major issues left it pretty useless to me. <br /></p><p>Yesterday, I tried out <a href="http://tinderbox.flock.com/builds/">the latest snapshot build</a>, and I'm very impressed with how far the application has come.&nbsp; For those of you that haven't heard of Flock, it's a new browser built on top of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">firefox</a> and has some features that have really pulled me in:</p><ul><li>Tight integration with external services (<a href="http://del.icio.us">delicious</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a>, most blogging software)</li><li>Search toolbar automatically searches recently viewed pages.&nbsp; Very Google Desktop like, but why in the world is the default search engine Yahoo?!<br /></li><li>Flock makes all of these "geek tools" extremely easy to use.&nbsp; I would *almost* recommend this browser to my techno-phobic parents!<br /></li></ul><p>There are still a few areas that I think could use improvements, especially the blogging client.&nbsp; Flock wasn't able to automatically configure <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/wireframe">my jroller blog</a>, and it also published my blog with an empty title.</p><p>Flock has also replaced the very intuitive firefox "side bar" with the notion of a "top bar".&nbsp; I think this is a <span style="font-style: italic;">big </span>mistake.&nbsp; This new top bar makes it even more confusing for users to differentiate the browser tools (navigation bar, url, buttons) from web page content.&nbsp; Viewing bookmarks in firefox, using <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/foxylicious/">the sweet foxilicious plug in</a>, is much less intrusive than how Flock only displays bookmarks in a separate tab.&nbsp; I think several of Flock's flagship tools would be better off utilizing the side bar feature that has worked so well for firefox (shelf, flickr photo uploading, blogging tools).<br /></p><p>Flock has taken a fresh approach to many tried and true browser concepts, such as bookmarks.&nbsp; First and foremost, I think it's time to rethink the concept of a browser download manager.&nbsp; Why hasn't <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/07/opera_does_bittorrent/">bittorrent been integrated into any major browser</a>?&nbsp; Flock has been titled the "social browser", and bittorrent seems to be a perfect fit.&nbsp; <br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> This blog was created and published using Flock's built in blogging client.
