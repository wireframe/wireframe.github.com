<h2>Now with 100% more AJAX!</h2><p>I couldn't resist spending some more time with Ubiquity after yesterdays exciting release.&nbsp; My <a href="http://www.jroller.com/wireframe/entry/ubiquity_is_like_crack">first version of a delicious bookmarking command</a> worked, but it definitely wasn't flashy.&nbsp; This was a perfect opportunity to learn the <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery javascript library</a> for AJAX interactions.&nbsp; I'm quite pleased with how it's turned out.</p><p>The new version posts the current page to delicious using ajax and posts whatever tags you type into the preview panel.&nbsp; Feedback and error handling is <em>much</em> improved, and it will automatically prompt you for your delicious username/password on first use (just like the twitter integration).&nbsp; I've already been using it personally for posting my bookmarks and it's amazing how intuitive this tool is.&nbsp; I don't think I'll ever go back.&nbsp; The official delicous bookmarklet and even the slick delicous firefox extension pale in comparison since it requires <em>evil</em> mouse interaction!&nbsp; <br /></p><br /><br /><p>I've published my Ubiquity command on <a href="http://www.github.com">github</a>, and hopefully it'll find a way onto the <a href="https://labs.toolness.com/ubiquity-herd/">official Ubiquity Herd</a> sometime in the future.&nbsp; In the meantime, I'd love to hear feedback or ideas for improvement!&nbsp; Feel free to fork my version, and tweak it to your hearts content!<br /></p><br /><br /><p>You can download the command directly from github at <a href="http://gist.github.com/7516%20">http://gist.github.com/7516</a> or just copy this command into your command editor. Ubiquity can also auto-detect changes to the latest version if you subscribe to the command using <a href="http://gist.github.com/7516.txt" rel="commands" name="Delicious Ubiquity Commands">this link</a>.</p><br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/7516.js"></script></div>
