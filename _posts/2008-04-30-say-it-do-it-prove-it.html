<p>There are lots of software development methodologies.  I've voiced my opinions over the years on how to create great software, and these three small statements sum up a pretty large part of my software development philosophy.</p><br /><br /><h2>Say it.</h2><br /><br /><p>Document your code.  Standard javadocs are fine.  Stick to method/class level docs with none of that body comment crap.  Give a <b>humane</b> overview of what you're trying to accomplish with the block of code.   This is also a great place to drop references to external documentation which may back up why a certain approach is being used.</p><br /><br /><h2>Do it.</h2><br /><p>Write your code.  Keep it clean and concise.  Only do what you said you're going to do and nothing more.</p><br /><br /><h2>Prove it.</h2><br /><p>Unit tests.  I don't believe you did what you said you were going to do without tests.  </p><br /><br /><p>Traditional TDD heavily emphasizes writing unit tests which *can* be used as a form of documenting what you're going to do, but I still find it valuable to have some level of documentation within the code itself (especially for interfaces). </p><br /><br /><p>Honestly, if more developers would just keep to these simple tips, we'd be a lot better off.</p></div>
