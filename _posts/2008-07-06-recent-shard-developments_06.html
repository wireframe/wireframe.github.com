<p>It's been a busy few weeks now that <a href="http://dndinsider.com">4th edition Dungeons and Dragons</a> is out the door!&nbsp; I've spent the majority of my free time digging into the new rule books, and you can definitely call me a fan of the new system.&nbsp; I'm very impressed by the streamlined game engine that avoids any &quot;rule lawyering&quot; and keeps the focus on having FUN!</p><p>To coincide with the 4th edition release, I've continued development on <a href="http://shard.codecrate.com">shard</a>.&nbsp; My initial goals are to revamp the codebase and prepare for implementing as many 4th edition rules as possible. The shard-grid API is first up and there are a few really exciting features that are underway.&nbsp; Of particular interest is a brand new path<br />finding algorithm that will dynamically build a path around obstacles<br />AND avoids difficult terrain whenever possible.</p><p>Some may question whether shard conflicts with the upcoming 4th edition digital tools, but I just can't stand to see tools created that only run on Windows.&nbsp; Seriously, what self respecting D&amp;D nerd <i>willingly</i> runs Windows!?&nbsp; The fact that I run Linux at home and a Mac at work and <i>neither</i> of these platforms are supported means that I'm out of luck and will be looking to other options for running my digital D&amp;D campaign.<br /></p><p>In other news, the shard codebase has moved off of <a href="http://shard.dev.java.net">java.net</a> and onto <a href="http://github.com/wireframe/shard">github</a>!&nbsp; This shouldn't be a big surprise since shard only used java.net as a source code repository, and CVS sucks major ass.&nbsp; Git is the absolute bomb, and I'm very excited to see folks experiment and enhance shard in a much more open fashion by using git.&nbsp; Hey, forking is good!</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
