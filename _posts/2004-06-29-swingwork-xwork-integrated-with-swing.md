[XWork](http://xwork.dev.java.net) is the extremely powerful action processing framework that serves as the foundation for popular projects like [WebWork](http://webwork.dev.java.net). I have recently started a new project [SwingWork](http://swingwork.dev.java.net) attempting to integrate XWork and Swing in a clean and consise way.


Currently supported features include:

  - Action execution occurs in background thread.
  - Several basic Swing containers can be used as results (JPanel, JDialog, JFrame).
  - Progress bar during action execution that can be updated while action executes.
  - Built in splash screen for launching applications.
  - Demo application with full source code.



Action frameworks are really taking off, and I would love to hear feadback (or possible participation) from anyone interested!
