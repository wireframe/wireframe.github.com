"Do your job.....plus one...."
   
- Me
   
   
This is somewhat related to my previous post, but slightly different.  My previous post was about not putting off to to tomorrow what you can do today.  This is about going the extra mile in what you do.  It's very easy to "Just do your job", which inevitably leads to shoddy work with plenty of loose ends.  If you really care about what you're doing, it's necessary to take the extra step to put the final touches on things.

"It takes 90% effort to complete 90% of the work.  It takes another 90% effort to complete the job."
