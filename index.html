    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Solving customer problems</strong> is the goal. Writing code is occasionally the solution.</li>
      <li><strong>Ship fast, learn faster.</strong> Time is the scarcest resource, so treat it that way. Structured execution and tight feedback loops compound results.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality starts at the foundation.</strong> Well-composed subsystems create resilient platforms.</li>
      <li><strong>Teams beat heroes.</strong> Great teams build great products. Great products build great companies.</li>
      <li><strong>Maker mentality.</strong> Rolling up my sleeves is still part of the job, and always will be.</li>

    <h2>The Path So Far</h2>
    <p>
      I've spent 20+ years building and scaling engineering organizations, products, and platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love the zero-to-one journey. I've scaled companies from pre-revenue startup to $250M+ ARR and unicorn valuation, and led product and engineering teams through hypergrowth, international expansion, and enterprise transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've worked across the full spectrum—from lean startup incubation at a Fortune 5 healthcare company to building world-class engineering organizations at high-growth startups. I know how to scale innovation teams while driving operational efficiency. Speed and quality aren't trade-offs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've learned a <i>lot</i> along the way, and have a whole lot <i>more</i> learning yet to do.
