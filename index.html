    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Solving problems is the goal. Writing code is occasionally the solution.</li>
      <li>Teams beat heroes. Culture beats strategy.</li>
      <li>Ship fast, learn faster. Lean startup principles in practice.</li>
      <li>Build composable systems. Domain-driven design over monoliths.</li>
      <li>Stay hands-on. A CTO who still codes is a CTO who still learns.</li>

    <h3>The Path So Far</h3>
    <p>
      20+ years building software and teams that matter. Started as an engineer
      scaling e-commerce at Digital River, then joined Socialcast from product inception
      through acquisition by VMware. Led innovation at UnitedHealth Group's startup
      incubator "The Garage." For the past 11 years at BetterUp, I've grown from CTO
      to CIO to Chief Technical Architect, building transformational products with
      world-class teams. Along the way, I've earned 2 patents in AI and coaching technology.
