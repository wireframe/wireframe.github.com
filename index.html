    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Solving customer problems</strong> is the goal—writing code is occasionally the solution.</li>
      <li><strong>Teams beat heroes.</strong> Culture beats strategy.</li>
      <li><strong>Ship fast, learn faster.</strong> Lean startup principles in practice.</li>
      <li>Platforms are built on <strong>composable systems</strong> and domain-driven design.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay hands-on.</strong> A CTO who still codes is a CTO who still learns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Path So Far</h3>
    <p>
      Technology executive with 20+ years of experience building and scaling engineering organizations, products, and platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proven zero-to-one builder. Scaled companies from pre-revenue startup to $250M+ ARR and unicorn valuation ($4.7B). Led product and engineering teams through hypergrowth, international expansion, and enterprise transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experienced across the full spectrum—from lean startup incubation at a Fortune 5 healthcare company to building world-class engineering organizations at high-growth startups. Skilled at scaling innovation teams while driving operational efficiency. Building fast doesn't mean building sloppy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plenty learned along the way. Plenty more waiting down the road.
