## The Luxury of Riches

Early-stage startups operate under brutal constraints. Never enough time. Never enough people. Never enough money. You're default dead, racing against the clock to earn your right to continue.

Scale-ups operate in the luxury of riches. Hundreds of employees. Millions in the bank. The existential pressure fades. And with it, something else fades too: urgency.

I've watched this pattern repeat across multiple organizations. A promising initiative gets staffed with four product teams instead of one. A design effort balloons to five designers producing "activity" without "motion." Teams grow so large they need restructuring just to function. The blank check mentality creeps in.

"Necessity is the mother of invention," Plato wrote. What happens when necessity disappears? You have to manufacture it by creating a *greenhouse* for incubating your innovation initiatives.

## From the Lab to the Greenhouse

The typical corporate response to the urgency problem is an innovation lab. Separate the disruptors from the operators. Give them bean bags and foosball. Let them move fast while everyone else keeps the lights on.

I've seen this model up close. It fails in predictable ways.

The "incubate and hand off" model destroys knowledge. One team builds the prototype, another team inherits it for production. The production team resents code they didn't write and don't understand. The innovation team resents being treated as a prototype factory. Critical context evaporates in the handoff.

Permanent separation creates class warfare. The cool kids get to innovate while everyone else maintains the legacy. Resentment builds. Morale suffers across both groups.

No real constraints means no real accountability. Without pressure to ship, scope expands. Without deadlines, decisions drift. Without clear success criteria, projects become permanent. The innovation lab becomes a fiefdom where activity masquerades as progress.

The greenhouse offers a different model.

When most people think about greenhouses, they think about protection. Keeping the cold out. Sheltering delicate seedlings. Real greenhouses do protect plants from harsh conditions. But they also *create* artificial conditions, controlling temperature, light, water, humidity. They manufacture growing seasons. A tomato plant doesn't know it's February in Minnesota. The greenhouse creates summer.

The same principle applies to innovation inside established companies. Protection from the corporate immune system matters. But the real power is manufacturing the constraints that force growth.

"Creativity doesn't just love constraints; it thrives in them," writes David Burkus. Orson Welles put it more bluntly: "The enemy of art is the absence of limitations."

Greenhouses impose real constraints with real consequences. The isolation is temporary. Failure is visible. Teams earn their right to continue or get composted. No one gets a permanent pass to the cool kids table.

## Controlling the Climate with Manufactured Constraints

An internal board of directors can act as venture capital, placing bets on teams with explicit constraints:

**Limited time.** Think of timeboxing as creating an artificial season. Plants don't have unlimited time to grow. Winter is coming. That pressure drives them to flower and fruit.

Your greenhouse teams need the same pressure. A clear timeline with clear success criteria. Miss your targets and you're "off track." Repeatedly off track without a credible path forward? The initiative gets composted. This is how Y Combinator operates. Batch constraints. Demo day deadlines. The pressure is the point.

**Limited resources.** The two-pizza team works as a forcing function, not just a heuristic. Hard caps on team size mean everyone stretches to own end-to-end details. No part-time "contributors" ballooning the headcount. No specialists who only touch "their part."

A fully-staffed squad of five to seven engineers costs roughly a million dollars per quarter. That number should feel real to the team, not abstract.

**Limited budget.** P&L constraints for marketing, user research, infrastructure. When you can't just throw money at problems, you get creative about solving them.

## Incubation Creates Insulation

The greenhouse walls insulate the growing environment from the outside world.

Organizations will try to kill new ideas. Not maliciously. Just people doing their jobs. Architecture review wants consistency. Security needs threat models. Legal needs compliance sign-off. Product management wants roadmap alignment. Each request is reasonable in isolation. Together, they suffocate anything new.

Ed Catmull nailed this in *Creativity, Inc.*: "Part of our job is to protect the new from people who don't understand that, in order for greatness to emerge, there must be phases of not-so-greatness."

For innovation teams, the greenhouse walls provide insulation from these organizational processes. Architecture review. Sprint ceremonies. SLAs. Code coverage requirements. Documentation standards. These processes exist for good reasons in the main organization. Inside the greenhouse, they're noise. The walls keep them out.

The only thing that penetrates the barrier is security. Branch protection, basic code review, not introducing vulnerabilities into the broader ecosystem. That's the floor that can't be negotiated away. Everything else? The team decides what "good enough" looks like for a prototype.

Build the right thing first. Build it right second.

The isolation is temporary. The same team that gets greenhouse protection this quarter might be back on maintenance next quarter. No permanent class of innovators.

## The Gardeners

Constraints only work with the right people inside the greenhouse.

You need a small, focused group of generalists willing to do whatever it takes. Backend, frontend, user research, sales calls. Everyone does everything. This is uncomfortable for specialists. That discomfort is a feature.

One Directly Responsible Individual owns it. Not a committee. Someone who makes fast decisions without consensus-building. Someone obsessed with this one thing.

Minimal management oversight. Define explicit touchpoints (weekly demos, monthly board reviews) and then get out of the way. The constraints do the managing.

## The Greenhouse Lifecycle

Every greenhouse project ends one of two ways: transplanting or composting.

**Transplanting** means the experiment proved out. The product found traction. The walls come down and the team begins hardening the seedling for the outside world. (Gardeners call this "hardening off" - acclimating plants to outdoor conditions before moving them outside.) The same people who built it are the ones who scale it. No handoff. No knowledge lost.

**Composting** means the experiment died. And most will. During my time at a healthtech startup incubator inside one of the largest healthcare companies in the country, ninety percent of initiatives didn't reach product-market fit. But the speed to learning was extraordinary. Decisions to spin down happened fast, driven by clear signals about talent, product, or market fit.

When a project gets composted, the learnings don't die with it. In nature, nothing is wasted. Dead plants decompose into nutrients for the next generation. Deliberate "composting" means extracting what you learned about the market, the technology, the approach, and distributing that knowledge back into the organization. Active fertilization, not a post-mortem that gets filed and forgotten.

Failure is visible. When ninety percent of experiments get composted, everyone sees it. The survivors earned their success.

Ninety percent failure rate sounds bad until you realize the alternative: slow-moving initiatives that consume resources for years without ever producing a clear signal. Fast failure with fast learning beats slow failure with no learning.

## Time to Plant

If you're an engineering leader trying to create space for innovation, protection isn't enough. You need to manufacture the constraints that make creativity thrive.

Build a greenhouse. Create artificial seasons. Limit time, resources, and budget. Make teams earn their right to continue.

The walls protect the new from the immune system. The constraints ensure it actually grows.
