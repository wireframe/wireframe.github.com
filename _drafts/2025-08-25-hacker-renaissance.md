> "Do you want to see the cool thing I built today?"

I think my family is getting sick of hearing this phrase. Every week another "crazy idea" turns into another semi-usable piece of software: a [Disney vacation planner](https://github.com/wireframe/disney-planner) with crowd calendar integration, a [voice-enabled AI rubber duck](https://github.com/wireframe/rubberduck) for debugging (complete with playful duck personality), a [machine learning model that classifies if a song qualifies as "butt rock,"](https://github.com/wireframe/is-it-butt-rock) a [Spotify plugin for random song discovery](https://github.com/wireframe/song-of-the-day), a [translation telephone game](https://github.com/wireframe/translate_telephone), and a [team topology graph visualizer](https://github.com/wireframe/team-topology-graph).

There is a feeling of immense joy turning these ideas into reality, even if they are "prototypes" and "toy apps".  Programming is __fun__ again.  And much of this can be accomplished in a matter of __minutes__.  What a time to be alive...  

## Changing the Build vs Buy Calculus

The time and effort required to build new applications is rapidly dropping.  What will this mean for the eternal build vs. buy technology decision?

### 1. Is it "mission critical"?  Do you need a product, or will a prototype suffice?
Don't be naive by the quality of the applications generated by agents.  This will improve over time, but current agent solutions fall squarely in the "prototype" quality bucket.  Yes, you can guide, shape, and prompt to get to "production" quality, but the time and effort required is significantly higher.

The 10x prototype advantage fundamentally changes the build vs. buy decision tree. Not every system needs production-grade perfection.

**Prototype-Ready Systems** (where 10x AI productivity applies):
- Internal tooling and process automation
- Specialized utilities for your specific workflow  
- "Nice to have" business functions
- Integration glue between systems
- Most of what you're paying SaaS subscriptions for

**Production-Critical Systems** (where you still get 10% improvement):
- Core payment processing
- Security infrastructure
- Regulatory compliance systems
- High-scale, high-reliability services

### 2. What is your bar for "good enough"?  How "minimal" of a product are you willing to accept?

Every software vendor has some amount of bloat beyond the essential features you need.  How much are you willing to spend for those extra, optional bells and whistles?  

One interesting case study is seeing [Klarna ditched Salesforce's flagship CRM](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/klarna-ceo-doubts-that-other-companies-will-replace-salesforce-with-ai/) in favor of their own homegrown system (built heavily with AI), and saving millions.

The same tools I'm using for weekend projects, Klarna used to replace enterprise software. The critical question they asked: **How mission-critical is perfect CRM functionality vs. good-enough functionality that we control?**

Here's the test: **If an AI can build a working version of your SaaS in a weekend, you're in the danger zone.**

Recent example from my team: multiple vendors pitched pull request automation solutions. Instead of evaluating features and pricing, we built a prototype over a weekend. It handles our specific workflow perfectly and costs nothing beyond development time.

This pattern is accelerating across:
- Workflow automation tools  
- Simple analytics dashboards
- Basic integration services
- Internal process management
- Specialized utilities with narrow use cases

What remains defensible? True production-complexity systems, network effects, and deep domain expertise with regulatory moats. Everything else is becoming commoditized by the weekend warrior approach.

## The New Build vs Buy Decision Framework

The build vs. buy decision is fundamentally different when building takes 10% of the time. "Good enough" internal solutions often beat "perfect" vendor solutions, especially when "perfect" includes features you'll never use.

1. **Is this mission-critical to my business?** (If yes → probably still buy)
2. **Can I live with "good enough" functionality?** (If yes → probably build)
3. **Is this primarily about convenience vs. core capability?** (If convenience → definitely build)

## Let's Get Hacking

The cultural shift feels profound. We've moved from "Not Invented Here" syndrome to "Why Pay For This?" pragmatism. When building takes 10% of the traditional time, the economic equation flips entirely.

$99/month SaaS subscription vs. three-hour Saturday morning build. Multiply by dozens of "convenience" subscriptions across your organization. The math starts looking very different.

The 10x productivity advantage for prototypes isn't just making development faster—it's making it joyful again. There's something deeply satisfying about building exactly what you need, exactly how you want it.

My weekend projects and Klarna's Salesforce replacement are points on the same curve. When building "good enough" solutions becomes this easy, the question isn't "Can we afford to build this?" It's "Can we afford NOT to?"

We're not just consuming software anymore—we're creating it again. This feels like 2005 because the democratization is back, but this time the ceiling isn't personal websites—it's enterprise software.

The barriers to creation have collapsed. The tools are exponentially more powerful. And that backlog of crazy ideas in your head? It's about to become your weekend shipping schedule too.

Time to get building.

## The Productivity Paradox

Everyone talks about increased developer productivity with AI, but the headline numbers miss the crucial detail. The reality is nuanced:

- **Production code:** ~10% productivity improvement (useful, but incremental)
- **Prototypes:** ~10x productivity improvement (revolutionary, game-changing)

This isn't about replacing senior developers writing mission-critical systems. It's about collapsing the time from "I wonder if I can build..." to "here's a working solution that does exactly what I need."

The evidence is sitting in my GitHub: Disney vacation planner, Spotify random song selector, translation telephone game—each built in hours, not weeks. The 10x advantage makes building feel effortless again.
